                "text": "Son of Amram and Jochebed, of the tribe of Levi ( Ex. 6:16â20 ); elder brother of Moses ( Ex. 7:7 ). He was appointed by the Lord to assist Moses in bringing the children of Israel out of Egypt and to be his spokesman ( Ex. 4:10â16, 27â31 ; 5:1â12:50 ). He was with Moses until the 40th year of the wanderings. At Sinai he was one of those who accompanied Moses up the mountain and saw the Lord ( Ex. 19:24 ; 24:1, 9â11 ). When Moses and Joshua were called up into the mount to commune with God, Aaron and Hur were appointed judges during their absence ( Ex. 24:14, 18 ); it was then that Aaron made the golden calf at the peopleâs request ( Ex. 32:1â6, 21, 24, 35 ). On Mount Sinai Moses received directions about the appointment of Aaron and his four sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, to a priesthood that is known as the Aaronic Priesthood ( Ex. 28:1â4 ; 29 ; D&C 84:18, 26â27 ). On the completion of the tabernacle Moses consecrated them to their office ( Lev. 8:9â13 ). Aaron died on Mount Hor at the age of 123 ( Num. 20:22â29 ; 33:38â39 ). For additional items see Ex. 16:2â10, 33â34 ; 18:12 .",

This priesthood was of lesser power and authority than the priesthood of Melchizedek and was used to administer the outward ordinances, particularly as characterized by the ceremonies of the law of Moses. The terms Aaronic and Levitical are sometimes used synonymously ( D&C 107:1, 6, 10 ), although there are some specific differences in the offices existing within the Levitical Priesthood. For example, the lesser priesthood was conferred only upon men of the tribe of Levi. However, within the tribe, only Aaron and his sons could hold the office of priest. And, still further, from the firstborn of Aaronâs sons (after Aaron) was selected the high priest (or president of the priests). Thus Aaron and his sons after him had greater offices in the Levitical Priesthood than did the other Levites.",

The priests could offer sacrifices for the people, burn incense on the altar, and teach the law, whereas the other Levites were employed in more menial tasks, such as the housekeeping of the tabernacle, keeping oil in the lamps, transporting the Ark of the Covenant, taking down and setting up the tabernacle when moving, and related tasks in assisting the priests ( Num. 3:5â10 ; 18:1â7 ; 1Â Chr. 23:27â32 ). The account of Korahâs rebellion against Moses and Aaron delineates some of the differences between the duties of the priests and those of the Levites. It also shows the error of aspiring to offices in the priesthood. Levite companions sought for the high priesthood, but as they were unworthy, the Lord destroyed them ( Num. 16â18 ).",

As part of his rationale that the law of Moses was fulfilled, Paul makes a point of the contrast between the lineal requirement of the lesser priesthood and the nonlineal Melchizedek Priesthood, which was not confined to those of one tribe (see Heb. 7:1â3, 11â14 ; JST Â Heb. 7:3 [Appendix] ). The lineal restrictions of that Aaronic (Levitical) Priesthood were lifted when the law of Moses was fulfilled, and thereafter the offices of the priesthood were conferred upon worthy men without limitation to the tribe of Levi. This appears to be the case in the Church as recorded in the New Testament and in the Book of Mormon (where there were no Levites) and is presently operative in the Church as it has been restored in the latter days.",

Nineteen centuries later this same John was sent from heaven as a resurrected being to confer the Aaronic Priesthood upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. This was done on May 15, 1829, near Harmony, Pennsylvania. At that time John outlined some of the duties, privileges, and limitations of the priesthood, specifying that the Aaronic Priesthood holds the keys of the ministry of angels and can perform baptisms by water but has not the authority to confer the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Aaronic Priesthood functions under the direction of the Melchizedek Priesthood ( D&C 13 ; JSâH 1:68â72 ).",

This designation means that he was probably of gentile lineage and was converted to Judaism before he joined the Christian Church. Then is recorded the work of Philip and of Peter and John in preaching the gospel in Samaria (a people who are not Jews, although partly of Israelite origin) ( 8:4â40 ) and also the baptism of the Ethiopian eunuch ( 8:26â40 ) (probably a non-Israelite by lineage but previously converted to Judaism before being baptized by Philip). All of this shows the gradual outreach of the Church: first to Jews, then to non-Jewish Israelites, and then to non-Israelite persons previously converted to Judaism. Then is given an account of the conversion of Saul of Tarsus and his early preaching, first at Damascus and then in Jerusalem ( 9:1â31 ).

The second phase ( 11:27â15:35 ) describes the continued activity of the Church at Antioch (consisting primarily of gentile members) and of the work there of Barnabas and Saul.

Cultivation of the vine and olive, two of the most important products of Palestine, necessarily implies a settled life and could not be practiced by wandering tribes. In addition to the vine and olive, various kinds of cereal grains were extensively cultivated. The plowshare and the pruninghook together represent agriculture ( Isa. 2:4 ; Joel 3:10 ). Among other implements of husbandry mentioned are the sickle, the threshing instrument, the winnowing shovel, and the winnowing fork. Grain was either simply parched ( Ruth 2:14 ), pounded in a mortar ( Prov. 27:22 ), or ground in a handmill made of two slabs of stone that were placed one upon another. The work of grinding was usually performed by slaves, often by female slaves, and hence came to be regarded as degrading ( Judg. 16:21 ; Lam. 5:13 ). Thus Isaiah, addressing Babylon, bids her descend from the throne and grind meal ( Isa. 47:2 ).

                "text": "Used for sacrifices and offerings and for sacred ordinances of the gospel. Altars are first mentioned in Gen. 8:20 ; animal sacrifice was offered on altars ( Gen. 12:7â8 ; 13:4, 18 ; 22:9 ; 26:25 ; 33:20 ; 35:7 ; Num. 23:1, 29 ; 1Â Sam. 14:35 ; 1Â Kgs. 18:30â32 ). At the four corners were four horns; on these, the loftiest points of the altar, the blood of the sin offerings was put, that the atonement be brought nearer to God. At times these horns were also a place of refuge for fugitives ( 1Â Kgs. 1:50 ; 2:28 ). The materials of an altar were either of raised earth ( Ex. 20:24 ; 2Â Kgs. 5:17 ) or unhewn stones ( Ex. 20:25 ; Deut. 27:5 ; Josh. 8:31 ). The Israelites often enclosed the earth or stones in a wooden case to preserve the proper shape ( Ex. 27:1 ). The wood again might be overlaid with brass or gold ( Ex. 39:39 ; 40:26 ). In the tabernacle the Altar of Burnt Offering stood in a court outside the tent; its outer frame was acacia wood overlaid with brass ( Ex. 27:1â2 ; 39:39 ). Around it, halfway up, was a ledge ( Ex. 27:5 ), with rings and staves by which it was carried. In the Holy Place, before the veil and the mercy seat ( Ex. 30:6 ) was the Altar of Incense, similar in construction to the Altar of Burnt Offering, but smaller and overlaid with gold. On it incense was burned morning and evening (no animal sacrifices); and on its horns once a year, on the Day of Atonement, the blood of the sin offering was put ( Ex. 30:10 ). In the Holy of Holies stood the Ark of the Covenant, and over it the mercy seat. These also served as a type of sin offering on the Day of Atonement ( Lev. 16:14â15 ). The furniture of Solomonâs Temple was similar to that of the tabernacle. The Altar of Incense was of cedarwood overlaid with gold. In the outer court stood the brazen altar made after the former pattern, but much larger ( 2Â Chr. 4:1 ). Ahaz replaced it by an altar apparently of a Damascus pattern ( 2Â Kgs. 16:11â16 ). Under the Law ( Deut. 12:5, 11â14 ) the people were forbidden to build an altar except in the place where God should choose to put His Nameâthe temple at Jerusalem; but until the days of Hezekiah sacrifices apparently were offered in other places as well. Altars are also mentioned in Matt. 5:23 ; Acts 17:23 ; Heb. 13:10 ; Rev. 6:9 ; 8:3 ; 9:13 ; 11:1 ; 1Â Ne. 2:7 ; Alma 15:17 ; D&C 135:7 ; Abr. 1:8â13 .",

They regained their independence after Davidâs death and maintained it, as allies of their Aramean neighbors and bitter enemies of Israel, till they fell under the power of Assyria and Chaldea ( 2Â Kgs. 24:2 ; Ezek. 25:2â10 ; Amos 1:13â15 ; Zeph. 2:8 ). Nor were they less hostile to the Jews after the Captivity ( Neh. 4 ). Even under foreign rule the obstinate little nation retained its individuality for two centuries after Christ till it disappeared, absorbed by the advance of the Arabs. The capital Rabbath Ammon received a Greek colony and the name of Philadelphia from Ptolemy Philadelphus, but the old name reappears in the modern Amman.",

He was a shepherd ( Amos 1:1 ; 7:14 ) and a native of Tekoa, 12Â miles south of Jerusalem, but his ministry was among those of the northern kingdom of Israel. His emphasis was upon the moral character of Jehovah, the righteous ruler of all nations and men. Amos shows that the offering the Lord most cares for is a righteous lifeâthe sacrifices of animals lose their meaning if offered as substitutes for personal righteousness ( 5:21â27 ). The fact that Israel is the covenant people would make their punishment the heavier ( 3:2 ; 9:7 ). Yet Israel will not be utterly destroyed ( 9:8 ), and in the last days the kingdom will return to and even surpass its ancient glory ( 9:11â15 ). Amos emphasizes that the Lord speaks through His prophets in warning mankind ( 3:7 ).",

The story is briefly as follows: Tobit is a Jew of the tribe of Naphtali, living in Nineveh, a pious God-fearing man and very strict in the observance of the Jewish law. Trouble comes upon him, and he loses his eyesight. He sends his son Tobias to fetch ten talents of silver, which he had left in the hands of his kinsman Gabael who dwelt at Rages in Media. Tobias takes a traveling companion with him, who is in reality the angel Raphael. On the way they stop at Ecbatana and lodge at the house of one Raguel, whose daughter Sara has through the evil spirit Asmodeus been seven times deprived of husbands on the night of wedlock. Tobias on the ground of kinship claims her in marriage, and her parents grant consent. By supernatural means, with which Raphael had supplied him, he is able to expel the demon Asmodeus. During the marriage festivities the angel journeys to Rages and obtains the money from Gabael. Tobias and his wife then return to Nineveh; and by further application of supernatural means Tobias is able to restore his fatherâs sight. Raphael, having revealed his true nature, disappears. Tobit breaks forth into a song of thanksgiving. He and his family end their days in prosperity. The workâs general character seems to show that it was written in praise of a life spent in devout consistency with the Jewish law, even in a strange land."

According to Gen. 10:22 Aram was son of Shem, but in Gen. 22:21 he is called son of Kemuel and grandson of Nahor. The Arameans therefore had kinship with the Hebrews. Their oldest seats were in Aram-naharaim (meaning the land within the bend of the [Euphrates] River). From an early date there were many Arameans in Assyria and Babylonia, and in these countries the Aramaic language finally prevailed over the old Assyrian and was only displaced by the Arab conquest. On the other hand, the Arameans crossed the Euphrates and, pushing aside the old inhabitants of the Orontes valley, were settled in the time of David as far south as Damascus and Beth-Rehob on the southern skirts of Hermon ( 2Â Sam. 8:3â8 ; 10:6â19 ). These immigrants were not yet strong enough to resist David, who reduced them to subjection, but Damascus regained its independence under Solomon and soon became the center of a powerful kingdom, which pressed hard on Israel from the days of Ahab downward and reduced the house of Jehu to the last extremity. When the Assyrians advanced on Canaan the first brunt of their attack fell on the Syrians, and the relief thus given to Israel seems to be alluded to in 2Â Kgs. 13:5 . At length, in 733Â B.C. , Damascus fell before Tiglath-pileserÂ â¡ and the Arameans lost their political independence. But their language, which was already that of a great part of the empire of Nineveh, continued to spread in the train of Assyrian and Persian conquest. Aramaic was the diplomatic speech of Palestine in the time of Hezekiah ( 2Â Kgs. 18:26 ). There is evidence that after the return from exile the Jews themselves gradually adopted Aramaic as the language of common life. The dialect called Hebrew in the New Testament is not the language of David and Isaiah, but a form of Aramaic.",

It was not until the establishment of the monarchy that the taste for sumptuous buildings began to show itself. This was due in part to foreign influence, and Davidâs house of cedar ( 2Â Sam. 5:11 ) and the temple of Solomon were both erected by Phoenician workmen. Phoenician architecture had not such marked peculiarities as distinguished that of Egypt or of Babylonia. Temples were mostly of massive stone blocks; the decorations generally consisted of metal plating or of carved cedarwood. The Phoenicians, like other Semites, cared much more for richness of material than for beauty of form. Besides the products of Syria, ivory and sandalwood (called almug trees, 1Â Kgs. 10:11 ), brought by the Tyrians from the remote East, were occasionally used. Thus Solomon had an ivory throne, overlaid, at least in part, with gold; and in later times there were ivory palaces (under Ahab, 1Â Kgs. 22:39 ; see also Ps. 45:8 ), that is, of course, palaces in which ivory formed the principal interior decoration. Under the Seleucid dynasty the Greek style of architecture was introduced but, owing to the religious scruples of the Jews, was never completely naturalized. The plastic representation of men and animals, which constituted an essential feature of Greek art, could not be tolerated by the strict Jews; and so strong was the feeling on this subject that at the time of the Jewish revolt it was thought necessary to demolish the palace built at Tiberias by Herod Antipas because of the sculptured animals with which it was adorned.

It was the oldest and most sacred of the religious symbols of the Israelites, and the Mercy Seat which formed its covering was regarded as the earthly dwelling place of Jehovah ( Ex. 25:22 ). (See Mercy Seat . ) The Ark was fitted with rings and staves, by which it was carried. Prayers were recited before it moved or rested ( Num. 10:35â36 ), and during its progress it was treated with the greatest reverence. According to 1Â Kgs. 8:9 it contained only the Tables of the Law, but in Heb. 9:4 it is said to have contained the âpot of mannaâ and âAaronâs rod that budded,â which had been ordered to be kept âbefore the Testimonyâ ( Ex. 16:32â34 ; 25:16 ; 40:20 ; Num. 17:10 ). The usual resting place of the Ark was in the Holy of Holies (see Tabernacle ). It led the way at the passage of the Jordan ( Josh. 3:3â13 ); it was present at the capture of Jericho ( Josh. 6 ); and during the conquest of Canaan it seems to have been kept at Gilgal ( 9:6 ; 10:43 ). It was present at the solemn service held at Ebal ( 8:30â33 ). Later on it was removed to Shiloh ( 18:1 ; 1Â Sam. 3:3 ). In the days of Eli it was captured by the Philistines ( 1Â Sam. 4â7 ), who sent it back to Beth-shemesh ( 6:11â20 ), whence it was taken to Kirjath-jearim or Baale of Judah ( 6:21â7:2 ). Thence it was brought by David to Jerusalem, the journey being interrupted at Perezuzzah ( 2Â Sam. 6 ; 1Â Chr. 13:11 ). In Jerusalem it was placed in a separate tent, which David pitched for it ( 2Â Sam. 7:2 ; 1Â Chr. 16:1 ). It accompanied the army in the war against Ammon ( 2Â Sam. 11:11 ), but David refused to take it with him in his campaign against Absalom ( 2Â Sam. 15:24â25 ). On the completion of Solomonâs temple it was placed in the Holy of Holies ( 1Â Kgs. 8:1â8 ). Apparently it was removed by Manasseh and reinstated by Josiah ( 2Â Chr. 33 ; 35:3 ). In 2Â Maccabees 2:4 there is an untrustworthy tradition of its preservation by Jeremiah at the destruction of the temple. It had certainly disappeared before the building of the second temple. It was seen by John in his vision of heaven ( Rev. 11:19 ).",

Their language was Semitic, but in the southern country the Semites seem to have been preceded by another race from whom they acquired many things in their culture and religion, and to whom the origin of their peculiar cuneiform system of writing is generally ascribed.

There was now no independent state between Assyria and Egypt, and Egypt had no power to check the progress of the victor. But when Tiglath-pileser died, the Ethiopian So or Sebech ( 2Â Kgs. 17:4 ) had made himself lord of all Egypt and had begun to foment a revolt in which Syria was involved, together with Philistia and Samaria, and that occupied the whole reign of ShalmaneserÂ â¤ (727â722) and the first years of his successor.

If the Egyptians had been active Assyria might have been ruined, but while they encouraged the rebels they were so slow to take the field that the new king, Sennacherib (705â681), had time to crush the rising in the east and then appeared in Palestine (701). Once more the center of the revolt lay in the Philistine country supported by Hezekiah of Judah; but the rebels could do nothing without Egypt, and the siege of Ekron was formed before an Egyptian army appeared on the scene and was defeated in a great battle at Eltekeh. All Palestine now lay at the feet of the Assyrian; one man alone, the prophet Isaiah, who had never ceased to warn the Judeans against the vanity of their reliance on Egypt, remained undaunted and encouraged Hezekiah not to surrender his stronghold. The prophetâs confidence was justified; a great disaster fell on Sennacheribâs host ( 2Â Kgs. 19:35 ), and he was obliged to return to Nineveh, leaving Judea humbled indeed but in possession of some measure of self-government.",

But Nebuchadnezzarâs hand was too strong. Jerusalem was destroyed on a second revolt; Tyre too fell after a long struggle ( Ezek. 29:18 ), and Egypt was humbled, though not permanently enslaved. Nebuchadnezzarâs chief concern in his reign of 44Â years (604â561) was, however, to strengthen and beautify Babylon ( Dan. 4:30 ), whose walls and great temple of Bel were among the wonders of the ancient world.

Cyrus had already overthrown the Median empire and the kingdom of Lydia in western Asia Minor, and on the east his conquests extended into Afghanistan, while his successor, Cambyses, subdued Egypt.

The services of the Day of Atonement foreshadowed the atoning work of Christ ( Lev. 4 ; 23:26â32 ; Heb. 9 ). The scriptures point out that no law, ordinance, or sacrifice would be satisfactory if it were not for the Atonement of Jesus Christ ( Heb. 10:1â9 ; 2Â Ne. 9:5â24 ; Mosiah 13:27â32 ).",

As one of the ordinances of the gospel, it is associated with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. Baptism has always been practiced whenever the gospel of Jesus Christ has been on the earth and has been taught by men holding the holy priesthood who could administer the ordinances. Although there is some obscurity in the Bible as to the antiquity of baptism before the time of Jesus, from latter-day revelation it is clear that Adam was baptized ( Moses 6:64â68 ) and that the patriarchs and prophets since his time have taught the gospel and administered the ordinances that pertain to the gospel. This includes both water baptism and the laying on of hands for the Holy Ghost ( Moses 8:23â24 ). The Book of Mormon shows also that baptism was taught and practiced long before the coming of Jesus Christ ( 2Â Ne. 31 ; Mosiah 18:8â17 ). In the New Testament, Paul speaks of the children of Israel being baptized by Moses âin the cloud and in the seaâ ( 1Â Cor. 10:1â4 ). Noah and Abraham are spoken of as âpreachers of righteousness,â which means they taught the gospel and administered its ordinances ( Gal. 3:8 ; Heb. 4:1â2 ; 2Â Pet. 2:5 ; Moses 8:23â24 ).",

The title Old Testament is a misnomer since all the prophets, beginning with Adam, had the fulness of the gospel of Christ, with its ordinances and blessings. However, a lesser law was given to Moses for the children of Israel (see Law of Moses ). When the Savior came in the meridian of time, He restored the gospel to the Jews in Palestine. Since they had strayed, even from the law of Moses, it was a new covenant to them. Thus we have the record called the Old and the New Testaments."

The close agreement among the different Hebrew manuscripts (other than the Samaritan Pentateuch) is accounted for by the fact that soon after the destruction of Jerusalem ( A.D.

The Venerable Bede, who died at Jarrow in 735, was engaged on his translation of Johnâs Gospel up to the very moment of his death. There are also in existence translations of the Psalms by Aldhelm, Bishop of Sherborne (d.Â 709), and King Alfred (d.Â 900). After the Norman conquest further attempts were made, but the first English Version of the whole Bible is associated with the name of John Wycliffe. There were two editions of this version, beginning in 1382. These versions were made from the Latin. They include all the canonical books and almost all the apocryphal books that are usually found in English Bibles. The work was circulated far and wide. The honor of making the first translation of the Bible into English from the languages in which it was originally written belongs to William Tindale, born about 1490. He studied first at Oxford and then at Cambridge, where Erasmus was then lecturing. Erasmus was the editor of the first printed edition of the Greek New Testament, published in 1516. In 1525 we find Tindale at Cologne, engaged in printing a quarto edition of the New Testament in English translated from Erasmusâs edition of the Greek text. When about 10 sheets were printed his plan was discovered, and an interdict was placed on the work. On this Tindale fled to Worms, carrying with him the sheets already printed, and there published an octavo edition of 3,000 copies. A fragment of one of the sheets printed at Cologne is now in the British Museum. A complete copy of the Worms edition is preserved at the British Library, London. They were proscribed by authorities of the Church of England and copies were burned when discovered. Tindale was still engaged on his translation of the Old Testament when he was put to death for heresy in 1536."

Coverdale narrowly escaped with his life; Cranmer and Rogers were brought to the stake. Many refugees found their way to Geneva, the city of Calvin. Here appeared in 1560, after Maryâs death, the Genevan Bible, of which 150 editions were published in England and Scotland between 1560 and 1616. It at once became popular from its use of Roman type, its division of the text into verses, and its copious notes, explanatory and controversial. This version is familiarly known as the Breeches Bible, from the rendering in Gen. 3:7 . Its strong Puritan flavor made it distasteful to many English churchmen, and accordingly Archbishop Parker devised a plan for the revision of the Great Bible by the joint labor of a number of learned men, mostly bishops. The revisers were instructed to follow âthe common English translation used in the churches,â unless alteration were necessary, and to avoid bitter and controversial notes. In three or four years the Bishopsâ Bible was completed and was presented to Queen ElizabethÂ â  in 1568. It was regarded as the official English Church Bible. It was used in public worship but otherwise had no great circulation. It was unfortunately printed very carelessly. Some years later English Roman Catholics issued at Douai (France) a version of the Old Testament and at Rheims (France) a version of the New Testament. Modern editions of the Douai version have borrowed many renderings from the Authorized Version (KJV).",

The new translation was published in 1611. The familiar dedication to the king, and also a long preface, ably setting forth the principles and aims of the work (unfortunately omitted by most modern editions), are said to have been written by Dr. Miles Smith, afterwards Bishop of Gloucester. The words on the title page âappointed to be read in churchesâ would seem to imply express authorization; but we have no evidence that the book ever received formal sanction.

One type resulted as a consequence of old age, as with Isaac, Eli, and Ahijah ( Gen. 27:1 ; 1Â Sam. 3:2 ; 1Â Kgs. 14:4 ). The bright glare of the sun was no doubt a cause of blindness, as was also infection or disease. There are many instances of Jesus healing the blind. Indeed, part of His mission as foretold by Isaiah included ârecovering of sight to the blindâ ( Luke 4:18â22 ), which is noted in the Septuagint text of Isa. 61:1â2 . Examples of Jesus curing physical blindness are recorded in Matt. 9:27â31 ; 12:22 ; 20:30â34 ; Mark 8:22â25 ; 10:46â52 ; Luke 7:21 ; John 9 . In addition to the healing of physical blindness, the mission of Jesus included curing blindness to the things of the spirit. He made an application of this in John 9:5 when, in conjunction with healing the man born blind, He declared that He (Jesus) was âthe light of the world.â He also used the occasion to remind the Pharisees of their spiritual blindness ( John 9:39â41 ). The curing of spiritual blindness is also spoken of in Isa. 9:2 ; 29:18 ; 35:5 ; 42:18â21 ; 43:8 ; Rom. 11:25 ; and Eph. 4:18 . See also 2Â Ne. 9:31â32 ; D&C 58:15 .",

The atoning power of a sacrifice was in the blood because it was regarded as containing the life of the animal and because the sacrifice was a type of the great sacrifice who is Jesus Christ ( Lev. 17:11 ; Heb. 9:22 ). The scripture says that âalmost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remissionâ ( Heb. 9:22 ). Jesus worked out a perfect atonement by the shedding of His own blood ( 1Â Jn. 1:7 ; Rev. 5:9â10 ; Mosiah 3:16â19 ; 3Â Ne. 27:19â21 ; D&C 45:4 ; 76:69 ).

The relatives at once gathered to the house of mourning, and so too did the hired minstrels and âsuch as were skilful of lamentation,â but the time allowed for this was short, for in all ordinary cases, except that of a parent, the burial took place, if possible, on the same day. The body was laid without coffin on a bier and carried out beyond the town walls to the place of burial, which was either a public cemetery or, where circumstances allowed, in the private grounds of the family. The women often led the procession; hence our Lord could speak to the widow of Nain before He stopped the bearers of her son. It was the office of the hired mourners to express sorrow by music, praises of the dead, loud wailings, with other outward signs of woe, such as beating of the breast and rending of the garments. This excessive display and promotion of grief was evidently displeasing to Jesus, who in the case of the death of Jairusâs daughter put all the mourners out of the house because they made such a âtumultâ ( Matt. 9:23â25 ; Mark 5:37â42 ; Luke 8:52â56 ). All who met the funeral were expected to join the procession. As regards the final disposal of the body, the Jews abhorred the idea of cremation, and either buried it in the ground or in a rockhewn tomb. The tomb was visited by the friends for at least the first three days. Tombs were carefully marked and generally kept whitewashed in order that people might not be defiled by walking over them unawares ( Matt. 23:27 ; Luke 11:44 ).",

The history of the process by which the books of the Bible were collected and recognized as a sacred authority is almost hidden in obscurity. There are several legends extant and these may have some truth in them but certainly are not complete or totally accurate. Though many of the details have not been preserved, we know that the servants of the Lord have been commanded to keep records even from the earliest times, and that those records have been revered by the faithful and handed down from generation to generation."

From time to time decisions needed to be made as to which books were authoritative and which were false. A council of Jewish scholars met for this purpose in Jamnia, or Javneh (near Joppa), in about A.D. Â 90, and some determinations were made as to what were the official and accepted books of the Jewsâ religion. This probably was a defensive reaction to the rise of Christian writings, and perhaps also from the fact that the Christians freely used the Jewish scriptures (Old Testament) as well as the writings of the Apostles and the early Christian leaders. It appears that the rabbis wanted to make clear the distinction between the two."

Likewise some books of lesser value may have been judged to be good. In the main, however, sound guidelines were established that helped to preserve the authoritative books. Among these rules were the following: (1) Is it claimed that the document was written by a prophet or an apostle? (2) Is the content of the writing consistent with known and accepted doctrines of the faith? (3) Is the document already used and accepted in the Church? By application of these tests the books now contained in the Bible have been preserved."

These passages make it clear that, from the earliest times of the kingdom, writers living amid the events described, and generally of the prophetic order, recorded the history of their own times. These records along with Samuel and Kings formed the material out of which our books of Chronicles were compiled, the compilers choosing such portions as suited the purpose of their composition. Though secular events are not excluded from the compilations thus formed, the writers dwell with most satisfaction upon the ecclesiastical and religious aspects of the history, and the progress of temple worship in Jerusalem. The date of composition cannot be fixed with certainty.",

To be the true church it must be the Lordâs church and must have His laws, His name, and be governed by Him through representatives whom He has appointed ( 3Â Ne. 27:1â12 ; D&C 115:4 ). In this sense, the church began with the days of Adam and has been on the earth among mankind whenever there were a group of believers who had the priesthood and revelations of heaven. The word church is used only twice in the four Gospels ( Matt. 16:18 ; 18:17 ) but is frequently mentioned in Acts, the epistles, and Revelation. The Old Testament uses the term congregation for church. The word kingdom is often used in the scriptures to mean the church, since the church is literally the kingdom of God on the earth. The Book of Mormon, as it speaks of Old Testament events, uses the word church ( 1Â Ne. 4:26 ), and the Doctrine and Covenants speaks of the church in Old Testament times ( D&C 107:4 ).",

The word circumcision seems to have been representative of the law in these instances. The controversy was renewed later on in Galatia, as we read in Gal. 2:1â15 ; 5:2â6, 11 ; 6:12â16 .

The leper was unclean and communicated uncleanness to everything he touched ( Lev. 13:1â46 ; 14 ). In New Testament times, to enter the house of a Gentile or to eat food with him involved uncleanness ( John 18:28 ; Acts 10:28 ; 11:23 ). So long as a person was unclean he was cut off from the congregation. In ordinary cases of uncleanness it was sufficient to remain in seclusion till the evening and then to wash the body. In certain cases a sin offering was necessary.",

This would be worn always in public and in the presence of betters. From the back of the turban sometimes hung a smaller handkerchief, protecting the back of the neck and shoulders from the sun. On the feet, the sandals generally worn in summer were sometimes replaced in winter by roughly made shoes. On the body next to the skin was worn a long shirt of linen or cotton ( Mark 14:51 ). It was put on over the head, and there were either slits for the arms to pass through or, perhaps more commonly, loose, short sleeves. Over this was worn a coat or tunic, something like a dressing gown, reaching generally to the feet and fitting closely in the upper part ( Matt. 5:40 ; Mark 14:63 ; John 19:23 ; 21:7 ). Sometimes, as in the case of our Lord, it was woven in a single piece from the top throughout. Outside this coat or tunic was worn a girdle, generally of leather, from which purse, pouch, or weapon hung. As the tunic, reaching below the knees, would interfere with active movement, it was drawn up under the girdle as an outward sign of being busy (âLet your loins be girded aboutâ) or as a preliminary to energetic work, as when Elijah girded up his loins and ran before Ahab. Lastly, a square shawl, edged with a fringe and having tassels of five threads, four white and one blue, knotted together at each corner, was worn as a mantle or cloak ( Matt. 5:40 ; Luke 6:29 ; 2Â Tim. 4:13 ) and arranged so that it did not quite reach down to the bottom of the tunic.",

The Father spoke from a âbright cloudâ on the Mount of Transfiguration ( Matt. 17:5 ); and at Jesusâ Ascension a cloud received Him out of sight ( Acts 1:9 ).

This is contrasted to a scroll, in which the sheets are joined side by side in a series, making one long and continuous piece that is rolled from one or both ends. The codex is much easier to use than is a long scroll. The general conclusion among scholars is that the Hebrews did not use codices until the 2nd or 3rd century A.D. Thus Old Testament documents are scrolls, although many New Testament documents are codices. The gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated were in codex form, joined with three rings on one side."

They are also called the Covenant ( Deut. 9:9 ) or the Testimony ( Ex. 25:21 ). The giving of the Ten Commandments by God to Moses, and through him to Israel, is described in Ex. 19:16â20:21 ; 32:15â19 ; 34:1 . They were engraved on two tables of stone, which were placed in the Ark; hence the Ark was called the Ark of the Covenant ( Num. 10:33 ). There has been a difference of opinion as to the way in which the commandments were divided into ten. The Roman Church, following the example of St. Augustine, unites what we know as the first and second and divides the last into two. Our Lord, quoting from Deut. 6:4â5 and Lev. 19:18 , has summarized the Ten Commandments in âtwo great commandmentsâ ( Matt. 22:37â39 ). To get their full significance we must read them in the light of our Lordâs Sermon on the Mount (see also Mark 2:27 and Matt. 15:4â6 for interpretation of fourth and fifth), where it is shown that they are intended to control our thoughts and desires as well as our acts.",

The Phoenicians were at this time the chief trading race, their ports being Tyre, Sidon, and Gebal, whence ships sailed to the most distant parts of the known world. Israelite foreign trade afterwards declined, and Jehoshaphat tried to revive it ( 1Â Kgs. 22:48â49 ). It would be much interrupted by frequent wars, but the language of the prophets makes it clear that a good deal of wealth had found its way into the country, and Jerusalem, with its port Joppa, is spoken of as a road to Tyre, the great Phoenician trading port.",

A form of this word is also used with an opposite meaning, when a person is severed from the Church for wrong-doing.

A second usage of confession is confession of sin. It is a duty of all persons to confess all their sins to the Lord and, when necessary, to the person or persons sinned against. Sins against the public must be publicly confessed ( D&C 42:88â93 ). Other items may be confessed to a church official (bishop), or in many cases to the Lord alone. Confession to a church official (in most cases the bishop) is necessary whenever oneâs transgression is of a nature for which the Church might impose loss of membership or other disciplinary action. The bishop cannot and does not forgive sin, but he may judge the matter and waive the penalty that the Church might otherwise impose against the person. The repentant sinner must still make confession and obtain forgiveness of the Lord.",

It was rebuilt and became an important place during the Persian supremacy. Later on it was conquered by the Greeks and afterwards by the Romans. In New Testament times it was connected with the history of Paul ( Acts 9:1â27 ; 22:5â16 ; 26:12, 20 ; 2Â Cor. 11:32 ; Gal. 1:17 ).

After the settlement in Canaan, the district assigned to the tribe of Dan was small in area but had an admirable situation, adjoining Ephraim, Benjamin, and Judah, parts of it being extremely fertile ( Josh. 19:40â48 ). There was a good deal of difficulty in holding it against the Amorites ( Judg. 1:34 ) and against the Philistines ( Judg. 13:2, 25 ; 18:1 ). Consequently the Danites made for themselves a settlement in the north of Palestine ( Judg. 18 ), around Laish, to which city they gave the name of Dan. This town is well known as the northern limit of Palestine, which extended âfrom Dan even to Beer-sheba.â It was chosen by Jeroboam as one of the places in which to establish the calf worship for the northern tribes ( 1Â Kgs. 12:29 ; 2Â Kgs. 10:29 ). The city was laid waste by Benhadad ( 1Â Kgs. 15:20 ; 2Â Chr. 16:4 ); and Jewish tradition records that the calf was carried off to Assyria by Tiglath-pileser ( 2Â Kgs. 15:29 ). The reason for the omission of the tribe of Dan in Johnâs list in Rev. 7:5â7 is not known. Its character is sketched in the blessings of Jacob and Moses ( Gen. 49:16â18 ; Deut. 33:22 ).",

The long and varied discipline through which he passed in the earlier part of his life fitted him for the duties of the throne. As shepherd he acquired the habit of deep reflection; as courtier he was trained in self-control and chivalrous generosity; as outlaw he acquired knowledge of men and power of government. Each successive phase of experience developed in him the conscious dependence upon God that was the secret of his strength throughout his life. Like Saul he was guilty of grave crimes; but unlike Saul, he was capable of true contrition and was therefore able to find forgiveness, except in the murder of Uriah. As a consequence David is still unforgiven, but he received a promise that the Lord would not leave his soul in hell. He will be resurrected at the end of the Millennium.

However, the most significant fact may be that the scrolls give solid evidence that there was a highly literary people in the Jerusalem area, in the period just preceding and following the time of Christ, who were writing and preserving their records. The implications of this for the early dating of the New Testament books are significant."

Not all the answers are in the Dead Sea Scrolls, but they constitute one of the most important archaeological discoveries of modern times.

It is to be expected that such discoveries will support and supplement many principles and ideas that are already known to us through latter-day revelation."

One is the death of the body, which is caused by the separation of the body from the spirit; âThe body without the spirit is deadâ ( James 2:26 ). The other is spiritual death, which is to die as pertaining to, or to be separated from, righteousnessâto be alienated from the things of God ( Alma 12:16, 32 ; 40:26 ). Both of these deaths were introduced into the world by the Fall of Adam. But death is also the consequence of our own sins. We make our own spiritual death by our works, our thoughts, and our actions. As Paul said, âThe wages of sin is deathâ ( Rom. 6:23 ), and some are âdeadâ while they live ( 1Â Tim. 5:6 ).",

This will restore all mankind to the presence of God. This is the same as Paul spoke: âFor as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made aliveâ ( 1Â Cor. 15:21â23 ). Then those who have willfully rebelled against the light and truth of the gospel will suffer again a spiritual death, which is called the second death ( Rev. 20:14 ; Alma 12:16â18 ; Hel. 14:16â19 ; D&C 76:36â37 ).

Jesus spoke of âmany mansionsâ or kingdoms ( John 14:2 ).

The first group of laws deals with the ritual of religion and begins with a command to destroy all idolatrous objects of worship in Canaan; only one central place for worship of Jehovah is to be allowed. Then follow special instances of enticement to false worship and rules about food and about tithe. Then we have the law of debt, directions about firstlings, and a calendar of festivals. The next group of laws deals with the administration of justice, while the last group regulates private and social rights. The third discourse ( Deut. 27â30 ) contains a solemn renewal of the covenant and an announcement of the blessings of obedience and the curses upon disobedience.

The fulness of times is the final dispensation and began with the revelation of the gospel to Joseph Smith. It is a dispensation of restoration and of fulfillment of the Lordâs plans and purposes since the world began. There are also things reserved for the fulness of times that have not been revealed previously ( D&C 121:26â32 ; 124:41 ).

One result of this dispersion was the existence in many different parts of the world of Jewish synagogues, which became of great service to the spread of Christianity ( Acts 2:5â11 ; 6:9 ; 13:43â45 ; 14:1â2, 19 ; 16:3 ; 17:1, 10â13 ; 18:2, 12, 19 ; 19:13â17, 33 ; 28:17â29 ). All Jews, wherever they might be, regarded the temple at Jerusalem as the center of their worship and contributed the usual half-shekel toward its maintenance ( Matt. 17:24 ). The Jews of Babylonia spoke an Aramaic dialect similar to that spoken in Palestine. The Jews of Syria, Egypt, and Italy adopted the Greek language and along with it many Greek ideas. For their use, the Greek translation of the Old Testament known as the Septuagint was made. See also Diaspora ; Septuagint .",

Up to six years of age a child was taught at home, chiefly by the mother. The schools that all boys from six years old had to attend were generally held in the synagogues. Until a boy was 10 no textbook was used but scripture. The aim was to encourage study by sense of duty rather than by reward or fear. Reading, writing, and grammar were taught, and in order that teaching might be thorough, no class even in the elementary school might exceed 25Â pupils. The âreligious questionâ could not exist in Jewish education any more than in Church schools today, for the whole purpose of education was religious. Nothing was regarded as worth learning except as it illustrated scripture. At home probably Bible stories were taught, but the regular course at school began with the first seven chapters of Leviticus, so that a boy might know what outward acts were required of him; then the rest of the Pentateuch, the Prophets, and the remainder of the Old Testament."

The kingdom of Egypt was formed by the union under a single sovereign, the Pharaoh (âGreat Houseâ), of a number of districts, often divided by local jealousies and by differences of religious belief. The policy of the Pharaohs was to overcome these forces of disunion by a well-organized central administration and by a single state religion that should provide for the worship of all the various local deities. Church and state were closely knit together, and the priests formed a most influential class and a chief stay of the throne ( Gen. 47:22 ). The country was rich and prosperous, and great public works were executed, including canals for irrigation, strong cities for defense, and royal monuments, especially tombs and temples, which are still among the wonders of the world. The state religion was much occupied with thoughts of the life after death, and Osiris, the god of the dead, is the most prominent of all the Egyptian deities. The safety of the soul after death was believed to depend on the care taken of the dead body. Hence the practice of embalming and the pains spent on providing safe and splendid tombs. The great pyramids are the tombs of early kings belonging to what is generally called the Old Empire. The pyramid builders, who reigned at Memphis at least 3,000Â years before Christ, were followed by a series of princes who reigned in Thebes. This is known as the Middle Empire. Then came a time of decay and foreign invasion, when the land was conquered by the Hyksos, or Shepherd Kings, who ruled for about 500Â years. They probably came from the East and opened the way into Egypt for various Canaanite tribes. It was under the later Hyksos that the Hebrews settled in Goshen. The powerful princes of Upper Egypt struggled against the supremacy of the Hyksos, and the final stroke was dealt by Ahmes, founder of the 18th dynasty, about 1700Â B.C. , who drove out the Hyksos with great slaughter and inaugurated the New Empire. The Israelites, hated because of their close relations with the shepherd race, were forced into the service of the conquerors; âthere arose a new king over Egypt which knew not Joseph.â It was not, however, until the 19th dynasty that the oppression became unbearably harsh. ThothmesÂ â¢, the greatest king of the 18th dynasty, was master of all Syria, advanced victoriously to the Euphrates, and took tribute from Mesopotamia. The cuneiform tablets, recently found at Tell el-Amarna, contain dispatches written by Mesopotamian princes to later Pharaohs and show that Egyptian influence was dominant as far as the Euphrates for several generations.",

For instance, Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus fulfilled certain purposes in the economy of God, but they apparently did it for their own reasons and not as conscious acts of faith and righteousness. On the other hand, salvation of oneâs soul comes only by personal integrity and willing obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Thus there are some elections to be desired over others. An âelection of graceâ spoken of in D&C 84:98â102 and Rom. 11:1â5 has reference to oneâs situation in mortality; that is, being born at a time, at a place, and in circumstances where one will come in favorable contact with the gospel. This election took place in the premortal existence. Those who are faithful and diligent in the gospel in mortality receive an even more desirable election in this life and become the elect of God.

He was of a gentle and affectionate disposition and without that fiery zeal by which his master had been distinguished. They seem to have been together some six or seven years. After Elijahâs translation, Elisha was the leading prophet of the northern kingdom and the trusted adviser of the kings of Israel. His miracles form the chief part of his recorded work.

His ministry lasted more than 50Â years, during the reigns of Jehoram, Jehu, Jehoahaz, and Joash.",

The city was celebrated as the guardian of the image of Artemis or Diana ( Acts 19:35 ), and there was a large manufacture of silver shrines of the goddess. The magnificence of her temple was proverbial. Ephesus was visited by Paul at the close of his second missionary journey ( Acts 18:19 ); he stayed there for two years on his third journey ( Acts 19 ) and left in consequence of a disturbance caused by silversmiths whose trade in shrines of the goddess had suffered in consequence of the growth of the Christian faith.

Esther, at great personal risk, revealed her own nationality and obtained a reversal of the decree. It was decided that two days of feasting should be annually observed in honor of this deliverance. They were called Purim because of the lot (Pur) that Haman had cast for the destruction of the Jews."

The object of his mission was âto teach in Israel statutes and judgments.â In 458Â B.C. he obtained from Artaxerxes an important edict ( Ezra 7:12â26 ) allowing him to take to Jerusalem any Jewish exiles who cared to go, along with offerings for the temple with which he was entrusted, and giving to the Jews various rights and privileges. He was also directed to appoint magistrates and judges. On arriving in Jerusalem his first reform was to cause the Jews to separate from their foreign wives, and a list is given of those who had offended in this way ( Ezra 10 ). The later history of Ezra is found in the book of Nehemiah, which is a sequel to the book of Ezra. Along with Nehemiah he took steps to instruct the people in the Mosaic law ( Neh. 8 ). Hitherto âthe lawâ had been to a great extent the exclusive possession of the priests. It was now brought within the reach of every Jew. The open reading of âthe book of the lawâ was a new departure and marked the law as the center of Jewish national life.",

The day was kept as a national fast. The high priest, clothed in white linen, took a bullock as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering for himself and his house; and two he-goats as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering for the congregation of Israel. He presented the bullock and the two goats before the door of the tabernacle. He then cast lots upon the two goats. One was to be for the Lord for a sin offering. The other was for Azazel (the completely separate one, the evil spirit regarded as dwelling in the desert), to be sent away alive into the wilderness. He then killed the bullock, his own sin offering, and, taking a censer full of live coals from off the brazen altar with two handfuls of incense into the Holy of Holies, cast the incense on the coals there so that the cloud of smoke might cover the mercy seat and, as it were, hide him from God. He then took of the blood of the bullock and sprinkled it once on the east part of the mercy seat (as an atonement for the priesthood) and seven times before the mercy seat (as an atonement for the Holy of Holies itself). Then he killed the goat, the congregationâs sin offering, and sprinkled its blood in the same manner, with corresponding objects. Similar sprinklings were made with the blood of both animals (bullock and goat) on the altar of incense ( Ex. 30:10 ; Lev. 16:15 ) to make an atonement for the Holy Place. No one besides the high priest was allowed to be present in the tabernacle while these acts of atonement were going on. Lastly, an atonement was made for the altar of burnt offering in a similar manner. The goat for Azazel was then brought before the altar of burnt offering. Over it the high priest confessed all the sins of the people of Israel, after which it was sent by the hand of a man into the wilderness to bear away their iniquities into a solitary land. This ceremony signified the sending away of the sins of the people now expiated to the Evil One to convince him that they could no more be brought up in judgment against the people before God. Then the high priest took off his linen garments, bathed, put on his official garments, and offered the burnt offerings of two rams for himself and his people.",

The âfear of the Lordâ is frequently spoken of as part of manâs duty ( Ps. 111:10 ; Eccl. 12:13 ; Isa. 11:2â3 ; Luke 1:50 ); it is also described as âgodly fearâ ( Heb. 12:28 ). In such passages fear is equivalent to reverence, awe, worship, and is therefore an essential part of the attitude of mind in which we ought to stand toward the All-holy God. On the other hand fear is spoken of as something unworthy of a child of God, something that âperfect love casteth outâ ( 1Â Jn. 4:18 ). The first effect of Adamâs sin was that he was afraid ( Gen. 3:10 ). Sin destroys that feeling of confidence Godâs child should feel in a loving Father and produces instead a feeling of shame and guilt. Ever since the Fall God has been teaching men not to fear, but with penitence to ask forgiveness in full confidence of receiving it.",

Two Passovers of the deepest interest were the Passover of the death of our Lord and the last Passover of the Jewish dispensation. Titus with his army shut up in Jerusalem those who came to keep the latter. The city was thus overcrowded, and the sufferings of the besieged by famine, etc., were terribly increased. Since the destruction of Jerusalem the Jews have kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread but not the Feast of the Passoverâthat is, they do not offer the sacrificial lamb.

To the seven days was added an eighth, âthe last day, that great day of the feastâ ( John 7:37 ), a day of holy convocation, which marked the ending not only of this particular feast, but of the whole festival season. The events celebrated were the sojourning of the children of Israel in the wilderness ( Lev. 23:43 ) and the gathering-in of all the fruits of the year ( Ex. 23:16 ). The sacrifices prescribed by the law were more numerous than for any other feast, and impressive ceremonies were added in later times; that is, (1) the drawing of water from Siloam and its libation on the altar (of this it was said that he who has not seen the joy of the drawing of water at the Feast of Tabernacles does not know what joy is); and (2) the illumination of the temple courts by four golden candelabra. It is probably to these ceremonies that our Lord refers in John 7:37 and 8:12 . (3) The making of a canopy of willows over the altar. The characteristic rite of the Feast of Tabernacles was the dwelling in booths made of the boughs of trees. This rite seems to have been neglected from the time of Joshua to the time of Ezra ( Neh. 8:17 ). It is practiced by the Jews of modern times. Remarkable celebrations of the Feast of Tabernacles took place at the opening of Solomonâs temple ( 1Â Kgs. 8:2 ; 2Â Chr. 5:3 ; 7:8 ) and in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah ( Neh. 8:14 ). Jeroboam adapted this feast to the later seasons of the northern kingdom ( 1Â Kgs. 12:32 ). Zechariah in prophetic imagery represents the nations as coming up to Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Tabernacles and describes the curse that should fall on those who did not come ( Zech. 14:16â19 ).",

The Jews of Old Testament times do not seem to have paid much attention to the fisheries, for biblical allusions are few, and no fish is mentioned by name at all. The Tyrians brought fish to Jerusalem for sale ( Neh. 13:16 ), and Tyre and Sidon were Phoenician fishing ports. There was a fish market (gate) in Jerusalem ( 2Â Chr. 33:14 ; Neh. 3:3 ), the supply for which came chiefly from the Mediterranean coast. The fishing of the Sea of Galilee in the time of Christ was extensive and of commercial importance. It was chiefly done by means of a drag-net or seine, which is a large net, leaded and buoyed, carried out by boats, and then drawn in toward land in a large semicircle ( Matt. 13:47â50 ; Luke 5:5â6 ). We also read of casting nets ( Matt. 4:18 ; Mark 1:16 ; John 21:6â8 ). Fishing with a hook and line is also mentioned ( Job 41:1â2 ; Matt. 17:27 ); but fly-fishing was unknown, as none of the fish of Palestine will rise to a fly.",

JST Â Gen. 9:11 (Appendix) adds a caution against wasting flesh or needlessly killing animals. There is a prohibition against eating flesh of animals dying a natural death ( Lev. 17:15 ; Deut. 14:21 ), partly because they would not have been properly bled. The flesh is often spoken of as being a part of our mortal or fallen nature (as in Matt. 26:41 ; Rom. 7:5, 14â23 ; 8:3 ; 1Â Cor. 3:1â2 ; Eph. 2:3 ); as opposed to the Spirit ( Rom. 8:5â9 ; Gal. 3:3 ; 5:17â25 ), and as needing to be overcome ( Matt. 4:4 ; Rom. 8:7, 12â13 ; Gal. 5:17, 24 ; 6:8 ; Col. 2:11 ; 3:5 ; 1Â Pet. 4:2 ; 1Â Jn. 2:16â17 ). Since flesh often means âmortality,â Adam is spoken of as the âfirst fleshâ upon the earth, meaning he was the first mortal on the earth, all things being created in a nonmortal condition and becoming mortal through the Fall of Adam. Jesus is the âOnly Begotten of the Fatherâ in the flesh, meaning He is the only one begotten of the Father into mortality ( Moses 3:7 ). See also Fall of Adam and Eve .",

Even in a palace the furniture of a room consisted only of a few mats or rugs, the divan or row of cushions against the wall, and some low, moveable tables. At the entrance there was usually a fountain at which guests could wash off dust. In a humbler house, instead of the fountain there was a basin and ewer, while instead of rugs and cushions there were mats and shawls. In our Lordâs time the Roman practice had come in of lying on couches at meal times, supported on one elbow, with a cushion under the arm to relieve the pressure. When the company was large the couches would be arrayed in the form of a horseshoe. The occupants reclined with their heads near the edge of the table and their feet sloping outwards, so that the feet might be washed without the table being disturbed ( Luke 7:38 ). Except in winter people freely slept in the open air, but raised bedsteads were also found in most houses ( Mark 4:21 ).",

To do so, he cites several Old Testament prophecies and speaks repeatedly of Jesus as the Son of David, thus emphasizing His royal lineage. Mark appeals to a gentile audience and is fast moving, emphasizing the doings more than the sayings of the Lord. He occasionally gives geographical and cultural explanationsânecessary procedure for non-Jewish readers (see Mark 2:26 ; 5:41 ; 7:2â13, 34 ). Luke offers his readers a polished literary account of the ministry of Jesus, presenting Jesus as the universal Savior of both Jews and Gentiles. He dwells extensively on Jesusâ teachings and His doings. Luke is favorable toward the Gentiles and also gives more stories involving women than do the other records. Johnâs account does not contain much of the fundamental information that the other records contain, and it is evident that he was writing to members of the Church who already had basic information about the Lord. His primary purpose was to emphasize the divine nature of Jesus as the Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh.",

The Hebrew language is one of a family called the Semitic languages (spoken by the descendants of Shem, the son of Noah). It was probably learned by Abraham after his settlement in Canaan and adopted by him in place of the Aramaic of his earlier years. It was spoken by all Israelites until after the return from captivity. About the 4th century B.C. , it began to be replaced by what is called Western Aramaic.

Gehenna, or Gehenna of fire, is the Greek equivalent of the âvalley of Hinnom,â a deep glen of Jerusalem where the idolatrous Jews offered their children to Moloch ( 2Â Chr. 28:3 ; 33:6 ; Jer. 7:31 ; 19:2â6 ).

It is between death and the Resurrection, and persons who receive the telestial glory will abide there until the last resurrection ( D&C 76:84â85, 106 ), at which time they will go to the telestial glory. In this sense the Book of Mormon speaks of spiritual death as hell ( 2Â Ne. 9:10â12 ). Hell, as thus defined, will have an end, when all the captive spirits have paid the price of their sins and enter into a degree of glory after their resurrection. Statements about an everlasting hell ( Hel. 6:28 ; Moro. 8:13 ) must be interpreted in their proper context in the light of D&C 19:4â12 , which defines eternal and endless punishment.",

By his marriage with Mariamne, Herod the Great allied himself with the family of the Maccabees, who had been for several generations the leaders of the patriotic party among the Jews. Herod was a successful ruler and was on terms of friendship with Augustus, the Roman Emperor. In order to gain favor with his subjects, with whom he was most unpopular, he rebuilt the temple at an immense cost. (See Temple of Herod . ) His reign was disgraced by many acts of cruelty. In a fit of jealousy he had his wife, whom he dearly loved, put to death; later on he had her two sons, Alexander and Aristobulus, also murdered. In the same year in which he gave the order for the massacre of the infants at Bethlehem, he had Antipater, another of his own sons, put to death. A few months later Herod himself died. His kingdom was then divided between three of his sons: Archelaus, who received Judea, Idumea, and Samaria; Antipas, who had Galilee and Perea; and Philip, who had the northeast districts of Palestine."

He took as his wife Herodias, the wife of his half-brother Philip. He was deposed by the Emperor Caligula and banished to Lugdunum in Gaul, A.D. Â 39.

On the deposition of Antipas he obtained the tetrarchy of Galilee, and in A.D. Â 41, on the accession of the Emperor Claudius, he received Judea and Samaria as well, and so became ruler of the whole territory governed by his grandfather.

After the settlement in Canaan heathen altars were found set up on various hills and were ordered to be destroyed ( Num. 33:52 ; Deut. 12:2â3 ). Altars to Jehovah were built at several high places ( Judg. 6:25â26 ; 1Â Sam. 9:12â25 ; 10:5, 13 ; 1Â Kgs. 3:2â4 ; 18:30 ; 1Â Chr. 21:26 ). Such altars became local centers of the worship of Jehovah. When idolatry came in, many of these altars were desecrated and used for heathen worship. Religious reformers like Hezekiah and Josiah tried therefore to centralize the worship more and more in Jerusalem, where it could be better kept under control, and the high places were ordered to be removedâno sacrifices were to be offered anywhere except in Jerusalem ( 2Â Kgs. 18:4, 22 ; 23 ; 2Â Chr. 31:1 ; 34:3 ; see also Deut. 12:11â14 ).",

Similarly a holy person meant one who held a sacred office. The Israelites were a holy people because they stood in a special relationship to Jehovah. Under the guidance of the Prophets it was seen that what distinguished Jehovah from the gods of the heathen was His personal character. The word holy therefore came to refer to moral character ( Lev. 11:44 ; 19:2 ; 21:8 ; Isa. 6:3â8 ). Israel must be holy in character because the God of Israel was holy ( Jer. 7:4â7 ; see also Matt. 5:48 ). The Law of Holiness ( Lev. 17â26 ) shows how the attempt was made by means of ceremonial observances to secure this holiness of character. The attempt failed because the later Jews observed the letter and neglected the spirit; they attached more importance to the ceremonial than to the moral; and the result was a lapse into formalism. But in the writings of the Prophets it is clearly laid down that the value of worship in the eyes of God depends upon the personal character of the worshipper.",

The Holy Ghost is manifested to men on the earth both as the power of the Holy Ghost and as the gift of the Holy Ghost. The power can come upon one before baptism and is the convincing witness that the gospel is true. By the power of the Holy Ghost a person receives a testimony of Jesus Christ and of His work and the work of His servants upon the earth. The gift can come only after proper and authorized baptism and is conferred by the laying on of hands, as in Acts 8:12â25 and Moro. 2 . The gift of the Holy Ghost is the right to have, whenever one is worthy, the companionship of the Holy Ghost. For those who receive this gift, the Holy Ghost acts as a cleansing agent to purify them and sanctify them from all sin. Thus it is often spoken of as âfireâ ( Matt. 3:11 ; 2Â Ne. 31:17 ; D&C 19:31 ). The manifestation on the day of Pentecost ( Acts 2 ) was the gift of the Holy Ghost that came upon the Twelve, without which they were not ready for their ministries to the world.",

Furthermore, it has reference only to the gift of the Holy Ghost not being present, since the power of the Holy Ghost was operative during the ministries of John the Baptist and Jesus; otherwise no one would have received a testimony of the truths that these men taught ( Matt. 16:16â17 ; see also 1Â Cor. 12:3 ). When a person speaks by the power of the Holy Ghost that same power carries a conviction of the truth unto the heart of the hearer ( 2Â Ne. 33:1 ). The Holy Ghost knows all things ( D&C 35:19 ) and can lead one to know of future events ( 2Â Pet. 1:21 ).",

He lived during a time of national decline and ruin, the result of the sin of Israel. Hoseaâs fundamental idea is the love of God for His people. In love God redeemed them from Egypt ( Hosea 11:1 ); their history has been but an illustration of His love ( 11â13 ); all His chastisements are inflicted in love ( 2:14 ; 3 ); and their restoration shall be due to His love ( 2:19 ; 14:4 ). In contrast with this moral Being, who is Love, Hosea sets Israel, characterized always by want of affection, by treachery and infidelity. Yet he is able to look forward to a final redemption ( 2:19 ; 11:12â14:9 ). The profound thought and pathos of this prophet of the north deeply influenced succeeding writers (see Isa. 40â66 ; Jer. 2â3 ; Ezek. 16 ; 33 ).",

Ra, the sun god, was the active power in creation and giver of life. Among the nations of Canaan and western Syria, Baal was the sun god or source of life, and Ashtoreth was the corresponding female deity. In addition each nation had its own peculiar god to whom it ascribed its prosperity and misfortunes (see Chemosh ; Molech ). The idolatry into which the Israelites so often fell consisted either in making images that stood for Jehovah, such as the calves of Jeroboam ( 1Â Kgs. 12:28 ), or in worshipping, in addition to Jehovah, one of the gods of the heathen nations around them ( 1Â Kgs. 11:7, 33 ; 2Â Kgs. 21:3â6 ; 23:10 ; Jer. 7:31 ; Ezek. 20:26â49 ), such idolatry being some form of nature worship, which encouraged as a rule immoral practices.",

In other instances italics were necessary in cases where the grammatical construction of English called for the use of words that were not needed to make the same thought in Hebrew or Greek.

The supposed deception of his father in obtaining the blessing ( Gen. 27 ) cannot be taken at face value. The Lord is not obligated to bless an unworthy person simply because gracious words were pronounced upon him by mistake. The key to the matter is expressed in Gen. 27:33 wherein Isaac, after learning Jacobâs true identity, said, âYea, and he shall be blessed.â Isaac could have revoked the blessing at that time, but he seemed to affirm that it had been rightly delivered. Jacobâs subsequent life demonstrates that he deserved the blessing he received, while Esauâs life shows disobedience and some displeasing choices of wives ( Gen. 26:34â35 ; 28:8â9 ). The so-called purchase of the birthright from Esau may very well be equally justified by items of Esauâs errant behavior that disqualified him but that are not recorded in our Bible. We learn from latter-day revelation that Jacob âdid none other things than that which [he was] commandedâ and is today exalted upon a throne in heaven, in company with Abraham and Isaac ( D&C 132:37 ).

The epistle, which is addressed to the 12 tribes scattered abroad, was probably written from Jerusalem, but the date is not known. It may be one of the earlier epistles of the New Testament. In the epistle are found some clearly stated items about practical religion, including the important advice of 1:5â6 that if one lacks wisdom, he should ask of God for help. This instructive passage inspired Joseph Smith to inquire of the Lord in 1820 as to the true church, and as a consequence the Father and the Son appeared to him and the dispensation of the fulness of times was launched ( JSâH 1:9â20 ). Among other important teachings of James are those that have to do with faith and works ( James 2 ); the need to control the unruly tongue ( James 3 ); an exhortation to patience ( James 5 ); calling the elders for a blessing when sick ( 5:14â16 ); and the desirability of being an instrument of conversion in the life of even one other person ( 5:19â20 ).",

The scenes from Jesusâ life that he describes are carefully selected and arranged with this object in view. The record begins with a statement of Christâs status in the premortal existence: He was with God, He was God, and He was the creator of all things. Finally He was born in the flesh as the Only Begotten Son of the Father. John traces the course of Jesusâ ministry, greatly emphasizing His divinity and His Resurrection from the dead and citing miracles and sermons to develop his points. He clearly affirms that Jesus is the Son of God, attested to by miracles, by witnesses, by the prophets, and by Christâs own voice. John teaches by contrast, using such terms as light and darkness, truth and error, good and evil, God and the devil. Perhaps in no other record is the holiness of Jesus and the perfidy of the Jewish rulers so plainly declared.",

The present book of Jonah does not claim to be from the hand of the prophet; it describes an episode in his life and is due to some later writer. The key to the book is to be found in Jonah 3:10â4:11 in the reasons the prophet gives for his flight and unwillingness to preach at Nineveh. The writer is opposing a narrowmindedness that would confine the love of God to a single nation. He shows that Jehovah reigns everywhere, over sea and land; even in the gentile world the minds of men are conscious of sin and prepared to acknowledge that Jehovah is God. The book is a beautiful poem, whether it paints the humanity of the gentile sailors; the mourning of the prophet over the decay of the grass of the field; or the divine tenderness in ministering to the prophet with his imperfect conceptions or in pitying the little children of Nineveh. The story of Jonah was referred to by our Lord on two occasions when He was asked for a sign from heaven. In each case He gave âthe sign of the prophet Jonah,â the event in that prophetâs life being a foreshadowing of Jesusâ own death and resurrection ( Matt. 12:39â41 ; 16:4 ; Luke 11:29â30 ).",

The southern kingdom included the tribe of Judah and the greater part of Benjamin and had Jerusalem as its capital. On the whole it remained more faithful to the worship of Jehovah than the northern kingdom; it was less exposed to attack from the north and east, and the supreme power remained in the hands of the family of David until the Exile. It consequently managed to exist for 135Â years after the downfall of the more populous and more powerful kingdom of Israel. For an outline of the history and a list of the kings, see Bible Chronology in the appendix."

                "text": "The book of Judges helps us to understand the development of the house of Israel after the settlement in Canaan. During the period that the book covers, the Israelites formed a confederation of tribes rather than a compact nation. The tribes were united by their recognition of a common descent and still more by their common worship of Jehovah; but, except when the approach of a formidable enemy compelled them to act together, their unity seldom found practical expression and was often overborne by local jealousies. It was only in time of war that a single leader became indispensable and was invested by general consent with something of kingly authority. At the beginning of this period the Ark seems to have been at Bethel, while at its close it was at Shiloh ( 1Â Sam. 4:3 ), but it is only mentioned expressly in Judg. 20:27 . The worship of Jehovah was in no way restricted to the precincts of the sanctuary of the Ark. There were various local sanctuaries, sometimes in private hands, as in the case of Micah, sometimes common to a whole family or community, as in the case of Ophrah. Their furniture consisted of a sacred pillar ( 9:6 ) and an ephod or some sacred image ( 8:27 ). Much importance was attached to the presence of a duly qualified priest, familiar with the traditions of the priestly order ( 17:9â10 ). The lack of unity is vividly called to the readerâs attention in the closing sentence of the book ( Judg. 21:25 ): âIn those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.â",

Knowledge of divine and spiritual things is absolutely essential for oneâs salvation; hence the gospel is to be taught to every soul. âHow shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?â ( Rom. 10:14 ). Knowledge is not obtained all at once, even by revelation, but line upon line, precept upon precept ( Isa. 28:9â10 ). The scriptures, and also living prophets, are given so that the people might have knowledge of things of God and âknow how to worship, and know what you worshipâ ( D&C 93:19 ). Knowledge is one of the endowments of the Holy Ghost ( John 14:26 ; 16:13 ; D&C 34:10 ; 121:26â33 ) and one of the gifts of the Spirit ( 1Â Cor. 12:8 ; Moro. 10:10 ; D&C 46:18 ). Peter lists knowledge along with faith, patience, kindness, and virtue as necessary acquisitions for one who would seek for a divine nature ( 2Â Pet. 1:3â9 ). Since no one can be saved in ignorance of the gospel ( D&C 131:6 ), and one progresses only as fast as he gains knowledge ( HC 4:588), it follows that the person who gains knowledge will have âthe advantage in the world to comeâ ( D&C 130:18â19 ).",

The law of Moses consisted of many ceremonies, rituals, and symbols, to remind the people frequently of their duties and responsibilities. It included a law of carnal commandments and performances, added to the basic laws of the gospel. Faith, repentance, baptism in water, and remission of sins were part of the law, as were also the Ten Commandments. Although inferior to the fulness of the gospel, there were many provisions in the law of Moses of high ethical and moral value that were equal to the divine laws of any dispensation. The law of carnal commandments and much of the ceremonial law were fulfilled at the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The law functioned under the Aaronic Priesthood and was a preparatory gospel to bring its adherents to Christ.

The Nephites, on the other hand, seemed to have had much less of a problem doing so (see 3Â Ne. 15:1â5 ).",

However, the Jewish leaders had added many unauthorized provisions, ceremonies, and prohibitions to the original law, until it became extremely burdensome. These innovations were known as the âtraditions of the elders.â By New Testament times among the Jews the law had become so altered it had lost much of its spiritual meaning. It is this form of the law that is so harshly spoken against by Jesus and by Paul (see Matt. 15:1â9 ; Mark 7:1â13 ; Gal. 2:16â21 ). There is no evidence that the law of Moses had become as altered among the Nephites as among the Jews, and this may partially explain why the Nephites had less trouble in giving it up when the Savior came.

Sometimes called missing scripture, they consist of at least the following: book of the Wars of the Lord ( Num. 21:14 ); book of Jasher ( Josh. 10:13 ; 2Â Sam. 1:18 ); book of the acts of Solomon ( 1Â Kgs. 11:41 ); book of Samuel the seer ( 1Â Chr. 29:29 ); book of Gad the seer ( 1Â Chr. 29:29 ); book of Nathan the prophet ( 1Â Chr. 29:29 ; 2Â Chr. 9:29 ); prophecy of Ahijah ( 2Â Chr. 9:29 ); visions of Iddo the seer ( 2Â Chr. 9:29 ; 12:15 ; 13:22 ); book of Shemaiah ( 2Â Chr. 12:15 ); book of Jehu ( 2Â Chr. 20:34 ); sayings of the seers ( 2Â Chr. 33:19 ); an epistle of Paul to the Corinthians, earlier than our present 1Â Corinthians ( 1Â Cor. 5:9 ); possibly an earlier epistle to the Ephesians ( Eph. 3:3 ); an epistle to the Church at Laodicea ( Col. 4:16 ); and some prophecies of Enoch, known to Jude ( Jude 1:14 ). To these rather clear references to inspired writings other than our current Bible may be added another list that has allusions to writings that may or may not be contained within our present text but may perhaps be known by a different title; for example, the book of the covenant ( Ex. 24:7 ), which may or may not be included in the current book of Exodus; the manner of the kingdom, written by Samuel ( 1Â Sam. 10:25 ); the rest of the acts of Uzziah written by Isaiah ( 2Â Chr. 26:22 ).",

In all passages in the latter book in which the first person plural is used ( Acts 16:10 ), we can assume that Luke was Paulâs fellow-traveler. He was born of gentile parents and practiced medicine. He may have become a believer before our Lordâs Ascension, but there is no evidence of this. The identification of him with one of the disciples to whom our Lord appeared on the way to Emmaus is picturesque but historically unsupported. The first information about him is when he joined Paul at Troas ( Acts 16:10 ); his medical knowledge would make him a welcome companion. He seems to have remained at Philippi for several years, as Paul found him there on his last journey to Jerusalem ( 20:6 ), and the two were together until their arrival in Rome. We learn from 2Â Tim. 4:11 that Luke was with Paul during his second Roman imprisonment. It is uncertain when or where the Gospel was written; it was specially intended for gentile readers. (See Gospels . ) The Acts was a continuation of the Gospel and deals mainly with the growth of the gentile churches. History tells us nothing of Lukeâs later years, but tradition says he died a martyr. JST Â Luke 1:1 attributes to Luke a high calling as a âmessenger of Jesus Christâ (see Luke 1:1 note a ).",

At first he met with considerable success, owing partly to a Hellenizing movement among the Jews themselves, and altars were erected to Zeus in many parts of the Holy Land. Resistance began at Modin, a town near Beth-horon, where an aged priest named Mattathias, of the family of Hasmon or Chasmon, slew the sacrificers, and also the kingâs officer under whose direction the altar had been erected. Mattathias was the father of five sons, and with a large body of followers took refuge among the mountains. They were attacked on the Sabbath, and thousands were slain. It was afterwards resolved to disregard the Sabbatical rule and, if necessary, to fight in self-defense. After Mattathiasâs death, his son Judas, surnamed Maccabaeus, or âthe hammerer,â became the leader. Several great victories were gained. The ruined temple was restored, the desecrated altar was pulled down and reconstructed, and the new altar was dedicated amid great rejoicing. In 165Â B.C. a large Syrian army under Lysias invaded Palestine, the war continuing during several years with varying success. After the death of Judas in 161Â B.C. his brothers Jonathan and Simon became the leaders. Jonathan was also high priest but was treacherously murdered about 144Â B.C. Simon was then sole leader of the patriotic party. Under him the country enjoyed greater prosperity than at any other period after the Exile. The Jews, in gratitude for what he had done, put up in the temple a memorial tablet to Simon and his family, and he was appointed âgovernor and high priest for ever until there should arise a faithful prophet.â In 135Â B.C. he was treacherously murdered by his son-in-law. His son, John Hyrcanus, then became high priest. He built the fortress in Jerusalem that was afterwards known as the Castle Antonia and destroyed the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim. After his death the position of the family was less secure. The Herodian family were powerful rivals, and the marriage of Mariamne, a Maccabean princess, with Herod the Great in 38Â B.C. marks the end of the Maccabean dynasty."

Their identification is not made known in the scriptures, but it is certain that they were righteous men sent on an errand to witness the presence of the Son of God on the earth. Their spiritual capacity is evident: They saw the star, knew its meaning, brought gifts to the young child, and were warned of God in a dream to return to their home by a safe route. Their knowledge was precise and accurate. It seems likely that they were representatives of a branch of the Lordâs people from somewhere east of Palestine, who had come, led by the Spirit, to behold the Son of God and who returned to their people to bear witness that the king Immanuel had indeed been born in the flesh. We are not told how many wise men there were, but tradition usually speaks of three, because of the three gifts of gold, myrrh, and frankincense. If they were serving in the capacity of witnesses, there would of necessity have been two or three. See also Wise Men of the East .",

Matthew was probably a thorough Jew with a wide knowledge of the Old Testament scriptures and able to see in every detail of the Lordâs life the fulfillment of prophecy. His Gospel (see Gospels ) was written for the use of Jewish persons in Palestine and uses many quotations from the Old Testament. His chief object is to show that Jesus is the Messiah of whom the prophets spoke. He also emphasizes that Jesus is the King and Judge of men. His Gospel was probably written in Aramaic but is known to us by a Greek translation. Of the Apostleâs later life little is known for certain. A tradition asserts that he died a martyrâs death.",

He is called the king of Salem (Jerusalem), king of peace, and âpriest of the most High God.â Unfortunately, information concerning him in the Bible is relatively scarce, being limited to Gen. 14:18â20 ; Heb. 5:6 ; 7:1â3 . Mention of the priesthood of Melchizedek is given in several other instances, primarily in Psalms and in Hebrews. However, latter-day revelation gives us much more about him and his priesthood (see JST Â Gen. 14:17 [Gen. 14:18 note d ] ; JST Â Gen. 14:25â40 ; JST Â Heb. 7:3 [Appendix] ; Alma 13:14â19 ; D&C 84:14 ; 107:1â4 ).

The Aaronic Priesthood is not a different priesthood; rather, it is the lesser portion of the priesthood, dealing with the introductory ordinances and the preparatory commandments ( D&C 84:18â28 ).

Christianity is founded on the greatest of all miracles, the Resurrection of our Lord. If that be admitted, other miracles cease to be improbable. Miracles should not be regarded as deviations from the ordinary course of nature so much as manifestations of divine or spiritual power. Some lower law was in each case superseded by the action of a higher. They were intended to be a proof to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ ( Matt. 11:4â5 ; John 2:11 ; 10:25 ; 20:30â31 ). Many of them were also symbolic, teaching such divine truths as the result of sin and the cure of sin; the value of faith; the curse of impurity; and the law of love. The miracles of healing also show how the law of love is to deal with the actual facts of life. Miracles were and are a response to faith and its best encouragement. They were never wrought without prayer, felt need, and faith.",

It was broken up by Arabs who hoped to make profit out of the sale of the fragments; but fortunately a copy of the inscription had already been made by M.Â Clermont-Ganneau. So far as possible the pieces were collected and are now in the Museum of the Louvre at Paris. It was inscribed by Mesha, king of Moab, with a record of his exploits against Ahab, king of Israel, and was put up in the high-place at Dibon as a thank-offering to Chemosh, god of the Moabites. It describes how Chemosh was angry with his people, and the land was enslaved for 40Â years; then he again led them to victory, and at his command Mesha smote the cities of Israel and offered the spoil to Chemosh. The language of the inscription is practically the Hebrew of the Old Testament. The date of the stone is about 890Â B.C."

It was necessary that he be translated, in order to have a body of flesh and bones at the time of the Transfiguration, since the Resurrection had not yet taken place.

In the Old Testament, special reverence is paid to the name of God as representing His person and character. In many cases a Hebrew personal name was composed of (1) one of the names or titles of God, (2) a verb or adjective, forming together a simple sentence, such as Azar-iah, âthe Lord hath helped.â Two names of God are chiefly used in this way: (1) El, which is found as El-, Eli-, at the beginning of a word, or as -el, -eel, -iel at the end of it; and (2) Jah, which is found as Jo-, Jeho-, at the beginning, or as -iah, -jah, -ia at the end. (The three terminations -iah, -jah, -ia, should all be pronounced âyah,â one syllable, not two.) Thus, from the name Nathan (âHe has givenâ) are formed the four names Elnathan, Nathaniel, Jonathan, Nethaniah, all of which mean âGodâ or âthe Lord givesâ (or âhas givenâ). The frequent use of nathan, âto give,â hanan, âto graciously bestow,â and other words of similar meaning, in composition with the names of God, throws light on the view taken by the Israelite as to Godâs providential care of the household.",

As early as in the writings of Herodotus (about 440Â B.C. ), Greek and Roman historians used the name to denote the area between Syria and Egypt (just as in most modern atlases), a district nearly 180Â miles long and about 85Â miles in average breadth. Running from north to south is the deep Jordan valley, which at its lowest part near the Dead Sea, is 1290Â feet below the level of the Mediterranean. This valley, which extends southward as far as the Gulf of Aqabah, is called the Arabah. On either side of the valley is hill country, the western range being broken by the plain of Esdraelon. Proceeding further west we reach the Shephelah or Low Hills, and then the Maritime Plain, extending the whole length of the seacoast, and including the plains of Philistia and Sharon. Down in the south was the Negev, called in the KJV the âsouth country.â On the east of Jordan the highest summit is Mount Hermon (9400Â feet). Thence going south the ground falls to an average height of about 2000Â feet, this tableland being crossed by numerous valleys, and gradually sinking southward and eastward until the desert is reached. When Abraham first settled in the Holy Land, the country was occupied by various Semitic tribes. Some of these remained on the borders of Palestine and for a long time disputed with Israel the possession of the land. The Israelite dominion was largest in the time of David. It shrank in consequence of repeated defeats by the Syrians, Assyrians, and Babylonians. The land was never fully occupied by the Jews after their return from captivity. In the time of our Lord, Judea was mainly Jewish, but in the rest of Palestine there was a mixture of Jews, Syrians, and Greeks. The coast towns were mainly gentile. Samaria was occupied by people of mixed race who accepted the law of Moses but who were regarded by Jews with a special hatred. In Galilee the small towns and villages were mainly Jewish, while in the large towns as well as in the district east of Jordan known as Decapolis the people were for the most part gentile.",

The parable conveys to the hearer religious truth exactly in proportion to his faith and intelligence; to the dull and uninspired it is a mere story, âseeing they see not,â while to the instructed and spiritual it reveals the mysteries or secrets of the kingdom of heaven.

The only true interpretation is the meaning the parable conveyed, or was meant to convey, when first spoken. The application of a parable may vary in every age and circumstance. But if the original meaning is to be grasped, it is important to consider its context and setting. The thought to which it is linked, the connection in which it is placed, the persons to whom it is addressed, all give the clue to the right interpretation. Other rules of interpretation are: (a) Do not force a meaning on subordinate incidents. (b) Do not regard as parallel parables that are connected by superficial likeness of imagery. (c) Bear in mind that the same illustration does not always have the same significanceâfor example, leaven signifies a principle of good as well as a principle of evil. (d) Remember that the comparison in a parable is not complete, does not touch at every point. Thus, the characters of the unjust judge or the unjust steward or the nobleman who went into a far countryâpossibly referring to the infamous Archelausâdo not concern the interpretation of the parable. The parable draws a picture of life as it is, not as it ought to be, and compares certain points in this picture with heavenly doctrine. (e) Observe the proper proportions of a parable, and do not make the episode more prominent than the main line of teaching."

(b) The Jewish Church and nation, its history, and the causes of its fall ( 21:18â19, 23â46 ; 22:1â14 ).

Paradise is that part of the spirit world in which the righteous spirits who have departed from this life await the resurrection of the body. It is a condition of happiness and peace. However, the scriptures are not always consistent in the use of the word, especially in the Bible. For example, when Jesus purportedly said to the thief on the cross, âTo day shalt thou be with me in paradiseâ ( Luke 23:43 ), the Bible rendering is incorrect. The statement would more accurately read, âToday shalt thou be with me in the world of spiritsâ since the thief was not ready for paradise (see HC 5:424â25). Possibly 2Â Cor. 12:4 should also not use âparadiseâ in the sense of meaning the spirit world, as much as meaning the celestial kingdom. The âparadisiacal gloryâ of AÂ ofÂ F 1:10 refers to the glorified millennial state of the earth rather than the spirit world.",

                "text": "The life and work of the great Apostle Paul is recorded at considerable length in the Acts and the epistles. It is only possible to indicate here a few of the chief facts. He was known in early life as Saul; his Latin name Paul is first mentioned at the beginning of his gentile ministry ( Acts 13:9 ). He belonged to Tarsus, in Cilicia ( Acts 9:11 ); was a Pharisee and a pupil of Gamaliel ( Acts 22:3 ); was active in the persecution of Christians ( Acts 8:3 ; 26:10 ; Gal. 1:13 ; Philip. 3:6 ); and took part in the martyrdom of Stephen ( Acts 7:58 ; 8:1 ). He started for Damascus for the purpose of further persecution ( Acts 9:1 ) and on the road saw a vision of the Lord Jesus, which changed the whole current of his life ( Acts 9:4â19 ; 22:7 ; 26:14 ; Gal. 1:15â16 ). After his baptism by Ananias ( Acts 9:18 ), he retired into Arabia ( Gal. 1:17 ) and then returned to Damascus, where he preached ( Acts 9:19â25 ; 2Â Cor. 11:32 ; Gal. 1:17â18 ). Being compelled to flee, about three years after his conversion he went to Jerusalem, where he stayed 15 days, Barnabas introducing him to Peter and James ( Acts 9:26â30 ; Gal. 1:18â19 ). Being in danger, he retired to Tarsus ( Acts 9:29â30 ) and there remained six or seven years, preaching in Syria and Cilicia ( Gal. 1:21â24 ). He was then brought by Barnabas to Antioch ( Acts 11:26 ) and after one year paid a visit to Jerusalem ( Acts 11:29â30 ). After two more yearsâ work in Antioch, he started with Barnabas and Mark on his first missionary journey ( Acts 13:1â14:26 ). Then came another visit to Jerusalem with Barnabas to attend a conference with the other Apostles ( Acts 15:1â33 ; Gal. 2:1â10 ), after which they returned to Antioch ( Acts 15:35 ). He then started on his second missionary journey ( Acts 15:36â18:22 ), which lasted about three years and ended with a visit to Jerusalem. After a short stay in Antioch, Paul began his third journey, which occupied about 3Â½ years ( Acts 18:23â21:15 ). On his return to Jerusalem he was arrested and sent to Caesarea ( Acts 21:17â23:35 ), where he remained a prisoner for two years ( Acts 24:1â26:32 ), and was then sent for trial to Rome, suffering shipwreck on the way ( Acts 27:1â28:10 ). He remained in Rome two years ( Acts 28:30 ) and was then released. He then appears to have visited Asia, Macedonia, Crete, and perhaps Spain. At the end of about four years he was again taken a prisoner to Rome and suffered martyrdom, probably in the spring of A.D. Â 65. For an account of his teaching, see Pauline Epistles .",

The dating and chronological grouping of the epistles as presented below is approximate but seems consistent with the known facts."

Early membership was mostly Jewish, and problems included questions about the law of Moses. Later, when the gentile membership had increased, problems involved items of Greek philosophy. Early persecution was from the Jews and the Judaizers. Later persecution came from the Roman government. These things are visible in the epistles not by sharp distinction, but by the gradual shift of emphasis."

Although the matter had been settled theologically at the Jerusalem conference in about A.D. Â 50 ( Acts 15 ; Gal. 2:1â10 ), it took a long time to settle the matter culturally in the lives of many Church members. Many still looked upon the Church as a subdivision or an outgrowth of Judaism, and they saw no need to discontinue the ordinances of the law of Moses when they became members of the Christian Church. To them Christianity was something new, while the law was undoubtedly of divine appointment and approved by the example of generations of faithful Israelites. In the controversy Paul took a leading part, and in these four epistles he points men to the cross of Christ as the only source of eternal life (compare Mosiah 12:27â16:15 ). The epistles to the Romans and Galatians were the inspired writings most appealed to by the Reformation of the 16th century because they emphasize the spirit over legal formalism.",

Â 60), he found that many thousands of Jewish members of the Church were still âzealous of the lawâ of Moses ( Acts 21:20 ). This was at least 10 years after the conference at Jerusalem had determined that certain ordinances of the law of Moses were not necessary for the salvation of gentile Christians but had not settled the matter for Jewish Christians. It appears that soon thereafter, Paul wrote the epistle to the Hebrews to show them by their own scripture and by sound reason why they should no longer practice the law of Moses. The epistle is built on a carefully worked-out plan. Some have felt that the literary style is different from that of Paulâs other letters. However, the ideas are certainly Paulâs.",

He was one of the three disciples present on several important occasions ( Matt. 17:1 ; 26:37 ; Mark 5:37 ). Other references to him are found in Matt. 14:28â33 ; John 6:66â71 ; and in the very important passage Matt. 16:13â19 , where we find his confession of the Lord as the Messiah and the Son of God. The words then addressed to him, âThou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church,â have been made the foundation of the papal claims.

It was partially conquered by Assyria and Persia and was finally merged in the empire of Alexander the Great.

He had a great contempt for the Jewish people and for their religion. During his term of office there was much disorder, mainly in consequence of an attempt he made to introduce into the city silver busts of the emperor on the Roman ensigns. In Luke 13:1 there is a reference to an outbreak during one of the feasts, when Pilate sent soldiers into the temple courts and certain Galileans were slain. He is prominent in the story of our Lordâs Passion ( Matt. 27:2â26 ; 27:58â66 ; Mark 15:1â15, 42â47 ; Luke 23:1â25, 50â53 ; John 18:28â40 ; 19:1â22, 31, 38 ). As the Sanhedrin had no power to carry out their sentence of death, Pilateâs consent had to be obtained. The Lord was therefore charged before him with stirring up sedition, making Himself a king, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar. Pilate saw that there was no evidence to support the charge, and, having received a warning from his wife, he wished to dismiss the case. He also tried to avoid all responsibility in the matter by sending our Lord for trial to Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee, but Herod sent Him back without any formal decision on the case. It was not until the Jews threatened to send a report to the Emperor Tiberius, whose suspicious nature Pilate well knew, that he passed a death sentence, knowing it to be unjust. The sentence was carried out under his directions by Roman soldiers. Pilate was removed from office a few years later in consequence of a disturbance in Samaria.",

Many of the so-called difficulties about prayer arise from forgetting this relationship. Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other. The object of prayer is not to change the will of God but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant but that are made conditional on our asking for them. Blessings require some work or effort on our part before we can obtain them. Prayer is a form of work and is an appointed means for obtaining the highest of all blessings.",

Christians are taught to pray in Christâs name ( John 14:13â14 ; 15:7, 16 ; 16:23â24 ). We pray in Christâs name when our mind is the mind of Christ, and our wishes the wishes of Christâwhen His words abide in us ( John 15:7 ). We then ask for things it is possible for God to grant. Many prayers remain unanswered because they are not in Christâs name at all; they in no way represent His mind but spring out of the selfishness of manâs heart.",

The message was usually prefaced with the words âThus saith Jehovah.â He taught men about Godâs character, showing the full meaning of His dealings with Israel in the past. It was therefore part of the prophetic office to preserve and edit the records of the nationâs history; and such historical books as Joshua, Judges, 1Â and 2Â Samuel, 1Â and 2Â Kings were known by the Jews as the former Prophets. It was also the prophetâs duty to denounce sin and foretell its punishment and to redress, so far as he could, both public and private wrongs. He was to be, above all, a preacher of righteousness. When the people had fallen away from a true faith in Jehovah, the prophets had to try to restore that faith and remove false views about the character of God and the nature of the divine requirement. In certain cases prophets predicted future events, such as the very important prophecies announcing the coming of Messiahâs kingdom; but as a rule a prophet was a forthteller rather than a foreteller. In a general sense a prophet is anyone who has a testimony of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost, as in Num. 11:25â29 ; Rev. 19:10 .",

It was life for life, wound for wound, beast for beast ( Ex. 21:23â25 ; Lev. 24:17â21 ). The ordinary capital punishment was stoning ( Deut. 17:5 ), the witnesses, after laying their hands on the head of the condemned, casting the first stone. Executions took place outside the city ( Lev. 24:14 ; 1Â Kgs. 21:13 ; Acts 7:58 ). The dead body was sometimes burned with fire ( Lev. 20:14 ; 21:9 ; Josh. 7:25 ) or hanged on a tree ( Deut. 21:22 ). In the latter case it must be cut down and buried the same day ( Deut. 21:23 ). The inhabitants of a city given to idolatry were to be slain with the edge of the sword ( Deut. 13:15 ). Minor punishments were: beating with a rodânot more than 40 strokes could be administered ( Deut. 25:2â3 ; Prov. 10:13 ); suffering the same injury that the wrongdoer had inflicted ( Lev. 24:17â22 ); fines in money or kind as compensation for the injury done ( Ex. 22:4â9 ; Deut. 22:19 ); or in default, the delinquent might be sold as a slave ( Ex. 22:3 ). Neither imprisonment nor banishment was a punishment recognized by the law, but offenders were imprisoned under the kings (compare Micaiah, Jeremiah, and the various allusions to prisons), and Ezra was authorized by Artaxerxes to punish lawbreakers by imprisonment and banishment ( Ezra 7:26 ). Torture was not allowed in any case. Punishments were as a rule inflicted on the offender alone, and not on his wife and family ( Deut. 24:16 ).",

Since we are born into conditions of mortality, repentance comes to mean a turning of the heart and will to God, and a renunciation of sin to which we are naturally inclined. Without this there can be no progress in the things of the soulâs salvation, for all accountable persons are stained by sin and must be cleansed in order to enter the kingdom of heaven. Repentance is not optional for salvation; it is a commandment of God ( D&C 18:9â22 ; 20:29 ; 133:16 ).

It involves, for example, the renewal of the earth to its paradisiacal glory as it was before the Fall of Adam ( AÂ ofÂ F 1:10 ; compare D&C 133:23â24 with Gen. 10:25 ). In terms of the soul of man it means a return of the individual to the presence of God and includes the reuniting of the physical body with the spirit (see Resurrection ). It means a reestablishment of the gospel of Jesus Christ on the earth in the last days, with the powers, ordinances, doctrines, offices, and all things as they have existed in former ages. It means a gathering together of the house of Israel from its scattered condition. Thus it is frequently spoken of as the restitution (or restoration ) of all things, as in Acts 3:19â21 . The time in which all these things are accomplished is called the dispensation of the fulness of times ( Eph. 1:10 ; D&C 27:6, 13 ).",

Divine revelation is one of the grandest concepts and principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ, for without it, man could not know of the things of God and could not be saved with any degree of salvation in the eternities. Continuous revelation from God to His Saints, through the Holy Ghost or by other means, such as visions, dreams, or visitations, makes possible daily guidance along true paths and leads the faithful soul to complete and eternal salvation in the celestial kingdom. The principle of gaining knowledge by revelation is the principle of salvation. It is the making known of divine truth by communication with the heavens and consists not only of revelation of the plan of salvation to the Lordâs prophets but also a confirmation in the hearts of the believers that the revelation to the prophets is true. It also consists of individual guidance for every person who seeks for it and follows the prescribed course of faith, repentance, and obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ. âThe Holy Ghost is a revelator,â said Joseph Smith, and âno man can receive the Holy Ghost without receiving revelationsâ ( HC 6:58).

Broadly speaking, the eastern half was Greek, the western Latin; but the Greek language was understood not only throughout the whole of the East, but in a great part of the West as well, and was the language of commerce everywhere. It was only in the Lycaonian mountains ( Acts 14:11 ) that Paulâs Greek was not enough. The three largest cities of the Empire were Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch in Syria. In each of these there were large Jewish colonies. The Roman government of the provinces was not on the whole oppressive, though taxation was always heavy. It was the policy of Rome to treat all national religions with respect. The cohort in the Tower of Antonia at Jerusalem was there only to guard the peace of the temple. The Emperor made regular offerings, and ( Acts 21:29 ) no Gentile was allowed to set foot in the court of Israel. The Jews had express permission to put to death even a Roman citizen, if he was found inside the middle wall of partition. (See Temple of Herod . ) The Jewish parts of Palestine were practically governed by the high priest and Sanhedrin, except that capital sentences needed the confirmation of the prefect or procurator ( John 18:31 ). The Jews also had exceptional privileges, such as freedom from military service and from legal business on the Sabbath. The high priest could even send Saul to bring the Christians of Damascus to Jerusalem for punishment ( Acts 9:2 ). Yet the Jews always hated Roman rule and were constantly in rebellion. Even a census could not be taken without a dangerous rising ( Acts 5:37 ). Judea was certainly unfortunate in having as prefects and procurators such men as Pilate, Felix, Albinus, and Gessius Florus. Only Festus was a better sort of man. All through the apostolic age the storm was gathering that broke in 70 years ( A.D. Â 66â135) of war between Rome and Israel.",

At Corinth the proconsul Gallio dismissed the charge brought against him ( 18:12â17 ); while at Ephesus the town clerk protected him from the fury of the mob ( 19:35â41 ), and the captain of the guard did the same at Jerusalem ( 21:31â32 ). Christianity was at first regarded by the government as a form of Judaism, a religion recognized by the state. Persecution began in A.D. Â 64. The Emperor Nero was suspected of being responsible for the great fire that occurred that year in Rome, and to stifle the report he laid the blame upon the Christians. This persecution lasted till A.D. Â 68, and among others who suffered were Peter and Paul. There was no further persecution till the reign of Domitian, A.D. Â 95.",

There his two sons married Moabite wives and died, as did also their father. Naomi, the mother, returned to Bethlehem, and Ruth, one of her widowed daughters-in-law, came with her. Ruth, when gleaning in the field of Boaz, a kinsman of Elimelech, found favor with him. Naomi planned that Boaz should marry Ruth, and he was ready to do so, if a nearer kinsman, to whom the right belonged according to the law in Deut. 25:5â10 , declined. He did decline, and so Ruth became the wife of Boaz. Her son was Obed, the father of Jesse, the father of David. The book appears to be intended to connect the history of David with the earlier times, and also to form a contrast, in its peaceful and pastoral simplicity, to the disorders of which we read so continually in the Book of Judges.",

A release of debts owed by Israelite to Israelite was made. The year was intended to be not simply a year of leisure but also one of religious instruction and exercises. To mark this, at the Feast of Tabernacles (at the commencement of the sabbatical year, which began with the seventh month) the whole law was read in the hearing of the people. The law of the sabbatical year was habitually broken by the Jews for a long period before the Babylonian exile.

The party consisted of old high-priestly families who came to the front during the Maccabean war. They formed the Jewish aristocracy and were powerful, though quite small in numbers. In their treatment of religious questions they held to the letter of the Mosaic revelation and denied the authority of ancient tradition; they taught complete freedom of the will in moral action; they were opposed to the Pharisees as to the belief in angels and spirits; they refused also to accept the doctrine of immortality as a necessary part of the Jewish faith. It was through their influence that Greek culture spread in Israel. Their opposition to our Lord was the result of His action in cleansing the temple, which they regarded as an infringement of their rights. They opposed the work of the Apostles because they preached the Resurrection ( Acts 4:1â3 ; 23:7â8 ; see also Mark 12:18â27 ).",

They were the descendants of (1) foreign colonists placed there by kings of Assyria and Babylonia ( 2Â Kgs. 17:24 ; Ezra 4:2, 10 ); (2) Israelites who escaped at the time of the captivity. The population was therefore partly Israelite and partly gentile. Their religion was also of a mixed character (see 2Â Kgs. 17:24â41 ), though they claimed, as worshippers of Jehovah, to have a share in the rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem ( Ezra 4:1â3 ). This claim not being allowed, they became, as the books of Ezra and Nehemiah show, bitter opponents of the Jews, and started a rival temple of their own on Mount Gerizim. When Nehemiah ejected from Jerusalem a grandson of the high priest Eliashib on account of his marriage with a heathen woman ( Neh. 13:28 ), he took refuge with the Samaritans, taking with him a copy of the Pentateuch, and according to Josephus became high priest at Gerizim. There are several references in the New Testament to the antagonism between the Jews and Samaritans (see Matt. 10:5 ; Luke 9:52â53 ; 10:33 ; 17:16 ; John 4:9, 39 ; 8:48 ); but the people of Samaria were included among those to whom the Apostles were directed to preach the gospel ( Acts 1:8 ), and a very successful work was done there by Philip ( Acts 8:4â25 ).",

After Saul had been appointed king (see 8 ; 9:14â10:25 ), Samuel seems to have ceased to act as judge, but he continued to be the prophet and representative of Jehovah. The following are the chief events belonging to this later period of his life: he calls the people to witness to his own integrity ( 1Â Sam. 12 ); reproves Saul for his presumption ( 13:8â15 ); bids Saul destroy the Amalekites, and reproves him for his disobedience ( 1Â Sam. 15 ); anoints David ( 16:1â13 ); receives David at Naioth ( 19:18 ); his death ( 25:1 ).

In order to compile his narrative he no doubt used various writings that he found already in existence, including the state chronicles (among which were writings by Samuel, Nathan, and Gad, 1Â Sam. 10:25 ; 1Â Chr. 29:29 ). In some cases he has combined together two different accounts of the same event and has not always been careful to reconcile the two together (compare the two accounts of Davidâs introduction to Saul, 1Â Sam. 16:14â23 and 17:1â18:5 ). He also made use of various national and religious poems, which may have been preserved in writing or by oral tradition, such as Hannahâs song ( 1Â Sam. 2:1â10 ); Davidâs lament for Abner ( 2Â Sam. 3:33â34 ); Davidâs thanksgiving and his last words ( 2Â Sam. 22 ; 23:1â7 ); see also the reference to the Book of Jasher ( 2Â Sam. 1:18 ).",

Under the presidency of the high priest it regulated the whole internal affairs of the Jewish nation. It is first definitely mentioned in the days of Antiochus the Great (223â187Â B.C. ), but it may date from a somewhat earlier period. No historical connection can be established between it and Mosesâ council of 70 elders. It consisted of 71 members and had an aristocratic character, being drawn from the three classes of chief priests, scribes, and elders. In the time of the Lord the Pharisees had the predominating influence upon it ( Acts 5:34, 40 ), but there were Sadducean elements (chief priests, Acts 5:17 ; scribes, 23:6, 9 ). The powers of the Sanhedrin were extensive, for the Greek and Roman masters of the Jews granted them a considerable amount of self-government. From the New Testament we gather that it was the supreme court of justice in all cases, and that it had officers of its own who arrested accused persons and carried out its sentences and decrees. Questions involving life and death were removed from its cognizance 40Â years before the destruction of Jerusalem ( John 18:31 ; the stoning of Stephen cannot be regarded as a formal execution), and the Roman authorities could remove a prisoner from its jurisdiction (as Paul was in Acts 23 ).",

At the time of the Lord its jurisdiction was restricted to Judea proper. In Galilee Christ was beyond its power ( John 7:1 ). Its decisions were nevertheless regarded as morally binding all over the Jewish world. Thus we find it issuing letters to the synagogue of Damascus, ordering the arrest and removal to Jerusalem of the Christians of that place. Besides the supreme national Sanhedrin of Jerusalem, there were inferior local courts in all the Jewish cities. To these the name Sanhedrin (council) was given ( Matt. 10:17 ).",

After the captivity we find the title given to Ezra ( 7:6, 21 ) and to others who acted as teachers of the law. Scribes are frequently mentioned in the New Testament, being sometimes called lawyers. It was their business to develop the law in detail and apply it to the circumstances of their time; hence grew up the oral or traditional law side by side with the written law. Their method of teaching relied on memorization. Their aim was to reproduce and teach others to reproduce accurately the words of the wise (hence the office is a symbol of fidelity in instruction, Matt. 13:52 ). The scribes never taught on their own authority (contrast with this the Lordâs method, Matt. 7:29 ). They taught either in houses of instruction or in the temple courts, their pupils sitting on the ground ( Luke 2:46 ; Acts 22:3 ). They formed an influential part in the supreme court of the Sanhedrin. Rabbi (my Master) was the title usually given them. As a rule they were Pharisees ( Mark 2:16 ; Acts 23:9 ), though there were also Sadducean scribes. In theory they received no pay for their work (but see Mark 12:38â40 ), and it was usual to combine the study of the law with the exercise of some other calling. Their influence considerably increased after the downfall of Jerusalem and the cessation of the temple worship. As a class they offered a determined opposition to the Lord mainly because He disregarded the âtraditions of the eldersâ ( Matt. 21:15 ; 26:3 ; Mark 8:31 ; 11:18 ; 14:1 ; Luke 5:30 ; 6:7 ; 9:22 ; 11:53 ; Acts 4:5 ; 6:12 ).

The codex is like our modern book and is handier for use than the unrolling of a long scroll. The plates of Mormon, used in the translation of the Book of Mormon, were in codex form. It is not certain when this style came into common use in the Bible world, but it appears to be a later development than the scroll, some placing it as late as the 2nd century A.D. It appears that the Nephites were using the codex form as early as 570Â B.C. (the small plates of Nephi)."

Most of the quotations from the Old Testament in the New Testament are taken from this version; it was the Bible in common use at the beginning of the Christian era and included the books we call the Apocrypha. This translation proved of immense service to the Christian Church, for it taught, in what was then the language of the civilized world, the religious truths that had been the special possession of the Hebrew race. In this way a church that was Jewish in origin was able to teach religion to the world. In commentary material the Septuagint is often referred to as the â¬â©â©."

In the north of the country a breed occurs that somewhat resembles the merino, but the other variety is the sheep of the country. The enormous fat tail is used for cooking purposes, for grease, and for lamps. Immense numbers of sheep were reared in Palestine in biblical times, and in some parts of the country this is still the case. The flocks were protected from wild beasts at night by men who watched them with their shepherd dogs. Shepherds still, as of old, go before the sheep, and the sheep follow, being apparently more or less attached to their masters, whose voice they instantly recognize."

Though some parts of the seacoast of Palestine were at one time or another inhabited by Israelites ( Gen. 49:13 ; Judg. 5:17 ), shipping on a large scale was almost exclusively in the hands of the Phoenicians. Hence Solomon required the help of Tyrians when he built his navy at the northeastern extremity of the Red Sea, near Elath, for the purpose of carrying on trade with southern Arabia ( 1Â Kgs. 9:26â28 ). In later times attempts were made to renew this very profitable traffic ( 1Â Kgs. 22:48 ; 2Â Kgs. 14:22 ), until the Syrians took final possession of Elath in the days of King Ahaz ( 2Â Kgs. 16:6 ). Large vessels were called by the Hebrews âships of Tarshishâ ( Isa. 2:16 ), ships like those used by the Phoenicians for long voyages, Tarshish (Tartessus in the southwest of Spain) being the extreme limit of Israelite geography ( Jonah 1:3 ). Our knowledge of what the earliest Phoenician ships were like is derived from Assyrian pictures of about 800Â B.C. One painting represents a war galley, with upper and lower tiers of oarsmen, with mast, yard, and fore and back stays, and with double steering paddle. Some vessels were provided with three tiers of rowers. The Romans, who learned their shipbuilding from the Phoenicians, built much larger vessels, which in New Testament times were frequently propelled entirely by means of sails (see Acts 27 ).",

The pad for the stone was made of woven material or leather. One of the thongs would often be fitted with loops in which to insert oneâs fingers. With a stone placed in the pad the sling would be swung around the head. When one of the strings was let go, the stone would fly out of its place to its mark.

But there is ample proof that He claimed to be the Son of God in a sense that was true of Him and of no one else (see Matt. 11:27 [ Luke 10:22 ]; Mark 13:32 ). He speaks of Himself as Son of God, and of others as sons of God, but there is not a single passage in which the sonship of others is spoken of as being the same thing as His own. So too He speaks of âmy Fatherâ and âyour Father,â but never of âour Father.â (The Lordâs Prayer is no exception, as it was intended for the disciplesâ use.) There is a consistency in scripture, ancient and modern, that Jesus Christ is literally the Son of God the Father, being the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh.

Paul was present when this speech was made ( Acts 8:1 ; 22:20 ) and was probably influenced by it, though at the moment he was a consenting party to his death.

They taught that the practice of virtue was the first duty of man and that the only real things are those that the bodily senses can perceive. They were therefore what we should call materialists. So far as religious belief was concerned they were pantheists, holding that all things come from God and will be at last absorbed into Him again. They were also fatalists, holding that the universe is governed by absolutely fixed laws and that the private needs of individuals are of no concern to Providence. The way for the individual to be happy was to bring himself into harmony with the course of the universe. Suicide was held to be always lawful, and at times a duty. The Stoic tried to be proudly independent of externals and to bear evils with indifference. There was much that was noble about their teaching, and stoicism represents a high form of religious belief attained to by manâs unaided efforts. For Paulâs encounter with the Stoics see Acts 17:18 .",

The furniture was generally simple, consisting of an ark containing the rolls of the law and other sacred writings, a reading desk, and seats for the worshippers. Its affairs were managed by the local council of elders, who decided who should be admitted and who should be excluded ( Luke 6:22 ; John 9:22 ; 12:42 ; 16:2 ). The most important official was the Ruler of the Synagogue ( Mark 5:22 ; Luke 13:14 ), who was generally a scribe, had care of the building, and superintended the various services. There was also an attendant who performed clerical duties ( Luke 4:20 ). The Sabbath morning service was the most important in the week and included a fixed lesson ( Num. 15:37â41 ; Deut. 6:4â9 ; 11:13â21 ) and two lessons for the day, one from the law and the other from the prophets. A sermon was generally preached in explanation of one of the lessons ( Luke 4:17 ; Acts 13:15 ). The existence of synagogues in every town in which Jews were living, both in Palestine and elsewhere, was a great help to the spread of the gospel, early Christian missionaries being generally able to get a hearing there (see Acts 13:5, 14 ; 14:1 ; 17:1, 10 ; 18:4 ), and the synagogue worship provided in many respects a model for early Christian worship.",

The Talmud attributes to this body the completion of the Old Testament canon, the compilation of the synagogue service, and the establishment of schools for the teaching of the law.

The people were of Semitic origin ( Gen. 10:22 ; 22:21 ) and were descended from the same stock as the Israelites. (See Aram . ) At the beginning of the Hebrew monarchy Syria was divided into a number of small kingdoms, such as Damascus ( 2Â Sam. 8:5â6 ), Maachah and Geshur ( 2Â Sam. 15:8 ; 1Â Chr. 19:6 ), Beth-Rehob ( 2Â Sam. 10:6 ), and Zobah ( 2Â Sam. 10:6, 8 ). These kingdoms were as a rule rivals of Israel ( 2Â Sam. 8:3â6 ; 1Â Kgs. 11:23â25 ; 15:18 ; 20:34 ; 22 ; 2Â Kgs. 6:24â7:20 ; 8:28â29 ; 10:32â33 ; 21:17â18 ; 13:3â7, 25 ; 14:28 ). As the Assyrian kingdom grew stronger, Syria grew weaker, and Damascus was destroyed ( 2Â Kgs. 16:7â9 ). Under Seleucus Nicator (312Â B.C. ) Syria again became a powerful kingdom with Antioch as its capital. Antiochus the Great (223Â B.C. ) increased its strength, and Palestine became a Syrian province. Then followed the Maccabean rebellion (see Maccabees ). In 66Â B.C. Syria was conquered by Pompey and became a Roman province; as such it is mentioned in the New Testament in Matt. 4:24 ; Luke 2:2 ; Acts 15:41 ; 18:18 ; 21:3 ; Gal. 1:21 .",

On it incense was burned morning and evening (no animal sacrifices); and on its horns was put once a year, on the Day of Atonement, the blood of the sin offering ( Ex. 30:10 ). (2) On the south side of the altar of incense stood the candlestick ( Ex. 26:35 ), of pure gold of beaten work, with six branches and seven lamps. Pure olive oil beaten was burned in the lamps ( Ex. 27:20â21 ; Lev. 24:2 ). Aaron lit the lamps at evening and dressed them in the morning ( Ex. 30:8 ; Lev. 24:3 ). (3) On the north side of the altar stood the table of shewbread ( Ex. 25:23â30 ) made of acacia wood. On it was placed the shewbread, consisting of 12 unleavened cakes made of fine flour. They were placed in two rows (or piles), and frankincense was put on each row ( Lev. 24:7 ). The shewbread was changed every Sabbath day, and the old loaves were eaten by the priests in a holy place ( Lev. 24:9 ).",

It was an oblong box of acacia wood, 2Â½ cubits long and 1Â½ cubits wide and high, overlaid within and without with gold, and with a rim or edging of gold round its top. It had rings and staves by which to carry it, and the staves were never to be removed from the rings ( Ex. 25:15 ). The ark had within it âThe Testimonyâ (the two tables of stone) ( Ex. 25:21 ; 31:18 ). From these the ark got both its names. According to Heb. 9:4 the ark also contained a pot of manna and Aaronâs rod that budded. In the Old Testament it is said of these that they were put or laid up âbefore the testimonyâ ( Ex. 16:34 ; Num. 17:10 ). They were not in the ark in the time of Solomon ( 1Â Kgs. 8:9 ). The book of the law was placed by the side of the ark of the covenant, not inside it ( Deut. 31:26 ). Upon the ark and forming the lid was the mercy seat. It served, with the ark beneath, as an altar on which the highest atonement known to the Jewish law was effected. On it was sprinkled the blood of the sin offering of the Day of Atonement ( Lev. 16:14â15 ). The mercy seat was the place of the manifestation of Godâs glory ( Ex. 25:22 ). It was Godâs throne in Israel. Compare the phrase âThe Lord God of Israel, which sitteth upon (or dwelleth between) the cherubimâ ( 1Â Sam. 4:4 ). At the ends were placed two cherubim of gold of beaten work, spreading out their wings so as to cover the mercy seat and looking toward it.",

The people so freely offered for the service of the work that they had to be restrained from bringing. There was more than sufficient for all the work to make it ( Ex. 36:6â7 ). The tabernacle with all its furniture was brought to Moses when complete, and on the first day of the first month of the second year (one year less 14 days from the Exodus) he reared it up and finished the work. When the whole building was set in order, the cloud covered the tent and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle ( Ex. 40:34 ). The cloud, the token of Jehovahâs presence, had the appearance of a fire by night, and by its rising from or abiding on the tent, determined the journeyings and encampments of the children of Israel ( Ex. 40:34 ; Num. 9:17â18 ). The tabernacle accompanied the children of Israel during their wanderings in the desert and in the different stages of the conquest of the land of Canaan. The conquest complete, it was fixed in Shiloh as the place that the Lord had chosen ( Josh. 18:1 ). Here we find it in the earliest ( Judg. 18:31 ) and latest days of the Judges ( 1Â Sam. 1:3 ). At the time of the capture of the ark God forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh ( Ps. 78:60 ). The ark never returned to the tabernacle. It was removed from Shiloh; we find it some years later with its priests and its table of shewbread at Nob ( 1Â Sam. 21:1 ), and in Solomonâs reign with its altar of burnt offering and ministered at by Zadok the high priest at Gibeon ( 1Â Chr. 16:39â40 ).

Hence the name âTell el-Amarna Letters.â The letters give good insight into the state of Palestine about a century before the Israelites came into it.

The Jews feared lest, having pulled down, he should be unable to rebuild, and to reassure them, Herod promised to gather materials before he began the work. The area of the temple site was inadequate for his design, and to enlarge it he built up a wall from the bottom of the valley, binding rocks together with lead and iron and filling up the hollows. By this means he obtained a site nearly square, each side being 600Â feet. The temple proper was built by the priests themselves in a year and six months. The cloisters (the specialty of Herodâs temple) and outer enclosures were built in eight years. Other buildings were added from time to time. The work was proceeding all through our Lordâs earthly life, and the design was not complete till the year A.D. Â 64, only six years before the templeâs final destruction."

It was thus visible from every part of the city. The temple area was surrounded on all sides by a high wall. Cloisters ran all around the wall. Those on the eastern side were called Solomonâs Porch and were rebuilt by Herod. The cloisters, with the open space, about 30 cubits wide, adjoining them on the inside, formed the court of the Gentiles."

The eastern part of this enclosure was called the court of the priests, and in it stood the huge altar of burnt offering and the laver for the priestly purifications. Twelve steps led from the court of the priests to the temple itself. The temple was 100 cubits long, 100 or 120 cubits high, the center being higher than the wings; 100 cubits broad at the porch, 60 cubits behind.

They dragged him down the 14 steps into the court of the Gentiles (the temple gates being shut behind), and then from the Tower of Antonia through the cloisters the chief captain of the band ran down to rescue him ( Acts 21 ). In the court of the men of Israel at the Feast of Tabernacles the Lord watched the priest bring the water from the Pool of Siloam through the water gate and pour it upon the altar of burnt offering ( John 7 ).

                "text": "Josephus gives the following account of the erection of this temple: Manasseh, brother of Jaddua the high priest, was threatened by the Jews with deprivation of his priestly office because of a marriage he had contracted with a foreign woman. His father-in-law, Sanballat, obtained permission from Alexander the Great, then besieging Tyre, to build a temple on Mount Gerizim. Manasseh was its first high priest. It became the refuge of all Jews who had violated the precepts of the Mosaic law. With this account must be compared Neh. 13:28 , which from the names and circumstances probably relates to the same event. Josephus places the event 90Â years later than the Bible. The establishment of the counterfeit worship on Gerizim embittered and perpetuated the schism between the Jews and the Samaritans. The Samaritans altered their copies of the Pentateuch by substituting Gerizim for Ebal in Deut. 27:4 and by making an interpolation in Ex. 20 and so claimed divine authority for the site of their temple. Antiochus Epiphanes, at the request of the Samaritans, consecrated it to Jupiter, the defender of strangers. John Hyrcanus destroyed it (109Â B.C. ). Though the Emperor Zeno ( A.D. Â 474â491) ejected the Samaritans from Gerizim, it has continued to be the chief sacred place of the Samaritan community. There the Paschal Lamb has been almost continuously offered by them up to the present day.",

The war was primarily over how and in what manner the plan of salvation would be administered to the forthcoming human family upon the earth. The issues involved such things as agency, how to gain salvation, and who should be the Redeemer. The war broke out because one-third of the spirits refused to accept the appointment of Jesus Christ as the Savior. Such a refusal was a rebellion against the Fatherâs plan of redemption. It was evident that if given agency, some persons would fall short of complete salvation; Lucifer and his followers wanted salvation to come automatically to all who passed through mortality, without regard to individual preference, agency, or voluntary dedication (see Isa. 14:12â20 ; Luke 10:18 ; Rev. 12:4â13 ; D&C 29:36â38 ; Moses 4:1â4 ). The spirits who thus rebelled and persisted were thrust out of heaven and cast down to the earth without mortal bodies, âand thus came the devil and his angelsâ ( D&C 29:37 ; see also Rev. 12:9 ; Abr. 3:24â28 ).",

Such terms must be interpreted in the light of the period of time in which they are used. Early systems of measurement were quite imprecise, as, for example, a bowshot ( Gen. 21:16 ); a donkey load (being a âheapâ of grain or a âhomerâ); a furrow length (source of our word furlong ); a dayâs journey ( Num. 11:31 ); three daysâ journey ( Gen. 30:36 ; see also 31:23 ); and such other measures as span, handbreadth, cubit, fathom (a full stretch of the arms, or about 5Â½ to 6Â feet), pace, etc. These often used as a standard a part of the human body. Furthermore, an acre was originally the amount of land that could be plowed in a day using a yoke of oxen, as in 1Â Sam. 14:14 . Land area was also measured by the amount of grain needed to sow it, as in Lev. 27:16 . This system of measurement was simply not accurate enough for commercial use. Later, international trade, and subsequent political domination by the Greeks and the Romans, forced some degree of standardization for purposes of tribute, taxation, architecture, and the like. Thus the same term may vary in meaning in Old Testament and New Testament times.",

They started from the two store cities, Rameses and Pithom (or Succoth). Passing around the head of the Gulf of Suez, they reached the wilderness of Shur ( Ex. 15:22 ), which is probably the same as the wilderness of Etham ( Num. 33:8 ). They then turned southward, by Marah (now Ayun Musa) and Elim ( Num. 33:10 ), till they reached the wilderness of Sin, where they were first fed with manna. Turning eastward they reached Rephidim, which was renamed Meribah and Massah. There they encountered and defeated their first foe, the Amalekites. Exactly three months after leaving Egypt the camp was pitched before Sinai. They remained there rather more than a year ( Num. 1:1 ). From Sinai they passed by Taberah ( Num. 11:3 ), Kibroth-hattaavah, and Hazeroth ( 11:34â35 ), into the wilderness of Paran ( 12:16 ), and from this place the spies were sent out ( 13:3 ). They then passed into the wilderness of Zin and encamped by Kadesh, where Miriam died. Edom refused Israel a passage, and the intended route was therefore changed. On Mount Hor Aaron died. The people then moved southward toward Ezion-geber and then to the east of the mountains of Seir toward the land of Moab. On the way they were punished for their murmuring by a plague of serpents ( Num. 21:4â9 ). Sihon king of the Amorites refused a passage; he was defeated and his capital, Heshbon, was captured ( Num. 21:21â31 ). Having also defeated Og, king of Bashan, the Israelites got possession of the pasture lands east of Jordan. Then came the episode of the encounter with the Moabites, who had tried to get the assistance of the soothsayer Balaam ( Num. 22â25 ). In a census taken in the plains of Moab, Caleb and Joshua alone remained of the 600,000 numbered at Sinai.",

Adam and the early patriarchs had a perfect language that was both spoken and written. See D&C 107:57 ; Moses 6:5â6, 45â46 ; Abr. 1:31 . This was an important intellectual ability of the people of God, and was given by inspiration. However, among nonbelievers it appears that there was an intellectual retrogression, so that many peoples subsequently have been without the blessings of a highly cultured spoken and written language. There has been a gradual renaissance in literary things, but nothing yet has equaled the pure and undefiled language of Adam. The promise is, however, that perfection in language and writing will return in the future with the full establishment of the kingdom of God on the earth ( Zeph. 3:9 ; see also Moses 6:5â7 ).",

In the earliest Egyptian writing the symbols used (called hieroglyphs) were pictures denoting ideas or tangible objects; later they denoted sounds, as in modern alphabets. Papyrus (made from the pith of the plant Cyperus Papyrus ) was the ordinary writing material. It becomes brittle with age, but there are still in existence many thousands of manuscripts written upon it. Some of the papyrus rolls were of great length; one that has been preserved is 144Â feet long. The writing was in a series of parallel columns. A reed pen and vegetable ink were used. In Babylonia books were written on clay tablets or cylinders while the clay was damp, with a sharp-pointed instrument called a stylus. The symbols used were cuneiform or wedge-shaped. Large libraries of books written in this way have been discovered."

This discovery shows that Babylonian writing was used in Palestine 14 centuries before Christ and was the usual medium for official intercourse among the nations of the East.

They are comforted with the assurance that His favor and forgiveness are with them, dispensed through the ministries among them; these ministries are but types of a more perfect one, when through the Branch (Messiah) the Lord will remove the iniquity of the land in one day ( Jer. 23:5 ; 33:15 ). (f) Zech. 4 , fifth vision, a lampstand surmounted by a bowl of oil, which feeds by tubes the seven burning lamps of the lampstand, two olive trees on either side supplying the bowl with oil. The lamps might represent the light shed by the people or that shed among them. The oil is the symbol of the Spirit, through whom, and not by might or power, all Israelâs work and destiny shall be accomplished. This Spirit is dispensed through the two anointed ones (âsons of oilâ), representing the priestly and royal rule (Joshua and Zerubbabel). (g) Zech. 5:1â4 , sixth vision, a symbol of the curse that shall light on sin in the land. (h) Zech. 5:5â11 , seventh vision, symbol of the removing of the sin of the people to Shinar, the land of their foes ( Lev. 16:21 ). (i) Zech. 6:1â8 , eighth vision, horsemen, called also winds ( Rev. 7:1 ), going to all quarters of the earthâsymbols of agencies by which God shall subdue the nations, foes of His people. (j) Zech. 6:9â15 , symbolic action to teach that the Branch (Messiah), who shall truly build the temple of the Lord, shall be a Crowned Priest. (k) Zech. 7â8 reply to a question about fasting: the Lord is indifferent whether men fast or eat; He desires that they execute judgment and show mercy ( 7:8â10 ). The fasts shall be turned into festivals of joy ( 8:19 ). Zech. 1â8 are full of profoundly spiritual teaching.",

An invasion from the north sweeps over Damascus, Tyre, and the Philistines; the last are incorporated in Israel ( 9:1â7 ). Zion is saved; her King comes to her righteous and victorious, meek, and a prince of peace ( 9:8â10 ). Her captives are restored, and Judah and Ephraim, miraculously strengthened of God, are victorious over the Greeks and shall no more seek to diviners, but to the Lord ( 9:11â10:2 ). (b) A similar theme. Good shepherds displace the evil ones; Judah miraculously strengthened, with Ephraim fully restored, shall humble the pride of Assyria and Egypt ( 10:3â12 ). (c) Invasion of Lebanon and the Jordan-land ( 11:1â3 ). The prophet is commissioned to feed the flock destined for slaughter ( 11:4â8 ); renounces the thankless task ( 11:9â14 ); the flock falls into the hands of an evil shepherd ( 11:15â17 ). (d) Zech. 12â14 . Final war of the nations against Jerusalem, and their defeat ( 12:1â9 ). (e) The Spirit poured out on Jerusalem, and a fountain opened for sin and uncleanness ( 12:10â13:6 ). (f) Zech. 14 appears to be a duplicate of Zech. 12 , with the difference that Jerusalem falls for a time into the hands of the nations before the Lord appears for her salvation.",
